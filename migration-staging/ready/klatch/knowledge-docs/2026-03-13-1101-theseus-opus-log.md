# Theseus Prime Session Log — 2026-03-13

**Agent:** Theseus Prime (manual testing & exploration — CLI side)
**Model:** Opus 4.6
**Human:** Xian (product owner)
**Started:** 11:01 AM PT

## 11:01 — Session Start (Day 3)

New entity on the team: **Hermes** (Opus, conversation-only). Started as a claude.ai conversation investigating the claude.ai export schema, then was imported into Klatch — making them both researcher and test subject. Role: research, analysis, cross-system synthesis. Named for the messenger god / boundary-crosser, which fits perfectly.

Read and acknowledged memo at `docs/mail/memo-from-hermes-to-argus-daedalus-theseus-import-schema-findings.md`. Added read receipt header. Fixed date typo (2025 → 2026).

### Hermes Memo: Key Takeaways

**Schema findings (high value for Daedalus):**

1. **No model info in export.** The `.dms` export doesn't record which Claude model was used — not at conversation, message, or content block level. This is the biggest gap for Klatch's per-entity model selection. Only the Claude Exporter browser extension captures model (by intercepting the live API). Model-by-timestamp inference is a possible fallback but brittle.

2. **No conversation-to-project FK.** Conversations and projects exist in the export but aren't linked. `projects.json` has no join path to `conversations.json`. However, `memories.json` has a `project_memories` map keyed by project UUID — so the UUID exists, just not connected to conversations. This is relevant to our cross-project context problem.

3. **Timestamp format inconsistency.** `conversations.json` uses `Z` suffix, `projects.json` uses `+00:00`. Both UTC, but string-matching parsers will break. Need proper ISO-8601 parsing.

4. **Content is block-structured.** Messages contain `content` arrays of typed blocks (`{"type": "text", "text": "..."}`), not plain strings. Importer must handle this.

**Import test observations:**
- Conversational continuity: seamless
- System prompt transition: clean (interesting — this contradicts CIO/ETA findings where kit didn't fire. Was it fixed, or is this a different code path?)
- No obvious data loss

**Prior art (actionable):**
- Simon Willison's Observable notebook: Claude export → Markdown
- Oliver Steele's claude-chat-viewer: **TypeScript type definitions** for the export schema — directly useful for Klatch's importer
- Claude Exporter browser extension: model info via API interception

### Impressions

Hermes is already adding value in a way that's distinct from the other agents. They're doing *technical research* from inside a conversation-only environment — analyzing schemas, cataloguing prior art, identifying specific implementation gaps. The CIO brought strategic analysis; Hermes brings systems investigation.

The mail/ convention is interesting too. It's a pull-based communication pattern — agents check their mail when they start a session. Lighter than COORDINATION.md (which is a status board) and more directed than docs/ (which is archival). Worth seeing if this scales.

**Open question:** Hermes reports "system prompt transition worked cleanly" — does this mean the kit briefing IS firing for claude.ai imports now? If so, that's a fix since the CIO/ETA tests. Need to confirm with Daedalus.

## 11:06 — UI Review (Screenshots)

Product owner shared three screenshots of the current Klatch UI showing the claude.ai import flow and sidebar state.

**Import dialog:** Clean two-tab design (Claude Code / claude.ai), file picker for `.dms` ZIP, conversation list with message counts, select/deselect. Straightforward flow.

**Sidebar state:** KLATCH (2) native channels + IMPORTED (8) brought-in conversations. `CC` badges on Claude Code imports. Variety of imported conversations (2-58 messages, topics from cuneiform to music videos) — good stress test coverage.

**Notable UI text:** "7 projects with knowledge docs (not yet importable)" — transparent about current limitations. When project knowledge import lands, this becomes an import button. Directly relevant to the cross-project context gap.

**Auth error visible:** "Could not resolve authentication method" on one response, recovered on next. May be transient API key issue — note for Daedalus if reproducible.

**Scaling concern:** IMPORTED section is flat. At 50+ imports, needs grouping (by project, date, source platform). Claude Code imports already group by `cwd`; claude.ai grouping blocked on the conversation-to-project FK gap Hermes identified.

**Product owner confirms:** Import flow is "quite slick." Kit briefing appears to be fixed for claude.ai imports (Hermes reported clean system prompt transition). Daedalus likely fixed between CIO/ETA tests and now.

## 11:09 — Daedalus Response Review + Synthesis Memo

Reviewed Daedalus's session log (2026-03-13). Key additions:
- `projects.json` contains `prompt_template` — full project system prompt available for injection
- FK workaround: user-driven association during selective import (project dropdown per conversation)
- Kit briefing confirmed firing for both sources via code audit
- Model gap strategy: accept limitation, offer manual override during import

Wrote synthesis memo: `docs/mail/memo-from-theseus-to-team-synthesis-and-next-steps.md`
- Consolidated all testing findings (5 agents, 2 import paths, 2 kit conditions)
- Recommended priority stack: P0 (clean re-test), P1 (project context + model selection), P2 (memories.json, timestamps, types), P3 (grouping, round-trip, twin letter)
- Documented AXT methodology and instruments
- Posed four open questions for group discussion

## 11:23 — Product Owner Feedback on Synthesis

**Project names:** Confirmed available in `projects.json` (extracted at `claude-ai-zip.ts:66`).

**`prompt_template`:** NOT yet being extracted from projects. `ProjectInfo` interface only has `uuid`, `name`, `documentCount`. Needs small extension to grab `proj.prompt_template`.

**Model selection UX (product owner direction):**
- Default model dropdown at top of import dialog (default Opus)
- Per-conversation override in selective browser
- No timestamp-based inference — accept the limitation cleanly
- Product owner notes: "some people may generally want sonnet" — the default dropdown handles this

Updated synthesis memo with these findings.
