## [0.8.5] — 2026-03-14

### Step 8¾: Import Refinements

Closes the fidelity gaps that the Theseus/Ariadne fork test revealed. Imported conversations now carry their full project context, and forked channels orient themselves correctly. The biggest release since Step 8 shipped — tests nearly doubled (266 → 493).

### Added
- **Project context injection (8¾a)**: First-class `projects` table. claude.ai imports auto-create projects from `projects.json` with prompt templates and knowledge docs. Claude Code imports create projects by `cwd` with CLAUDE.md and MEMORY.md content. 4-layer system prompt assembly: kit briefing → project instructions → channel prompt → entity prompt. Project API (full CRUD). `findOrCreateProject` idempotent by source identity.
- **Kit briefing verification (8¾b)**: Theseus Prime confirmed 0% phantom tool rate across all fork continuity tests. Kit briefing correctly orients imported conversations — agents know they're in Klatch without tool access.
- **claude.ai re-branching (8¾c)**: Already-imported conversations are now selectable for re-import. Visual states show "(re-branch)" vs "(already imported)". Submit button shows re-branch count. `forceImport` flag bypasses dedup, creates new channel with disambiguation suffix.
- **Claude Code session browser (8¾d)**: Scan `~/.claude/projects/` to discover importable sessions. Preview panel with message counts, timestamps, and import status. Multi-select import with progress tracking.
- **Model detection gaps documentation (8¾e)**: Documented that claude.ai exports contain no model info at any level. Decision: accept limitation, default to channel model.
- **Agent Experience Testing (AXT) research**: Fork Continuity Quiz v3, three-factor fidelity model (project context × compaction loss × knowledge location), 4-level fidelity framework.
- **memories.json char array fix**: Detects and joins character arrays (`["H","e","l","l","o"]` → `"Hello"`) in project memories. Bug discovered during Theseus Day 4 testing.
- **Project knowledge doc extraction**: Extracts and concatenates text from project knowledge documents in claude.ai exports.
- **Kit briefing deduplication**: CLAUDE.md content moves to project layer for linked channels; stays as fallback for legacy imports. No double-injection.

### Changed
- Import dialog updated: projects show "(instructions will be imported)", memories show "(included in project context)".
- System prompt now 4-layer instead of 2-layer (kit briefing and project layers added).
- Project instructions limit bumped to 32K characters.
- GitHub issue #5 (Step 8¾) closed with all criteria met.

### Technical
- 493 tests passing (388 server + 105 client). 227 new tests since v0.8.2.
- New tables: `projects` (id, name, instructions, source, source_metadata), `channels.project_id` FK.
- New routes: `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/projects`, project CRUD and channel linking.
- New queries: `findOrCreateProject()`, `getProjectForChannel()`, `setChannelProject()`, full project CRUD.
- `buildSystemPrompt()` updated for 4-layer assembly with project lookup.
- `extractFromZip()` now extracts projects, memories, and project memories from claude.ai exports.
- `joinIfCharArray()` utility for memories.json char array bug.
- Multi-agent team: Daedalus (architecture), Argus (quality, 4 test phases), Theseus Prime (AXT), Ariadne (Klatch-side), Hermes (research), Calliope (writing).

## [0.8.2] — 2026-03-11

### Step 8 Complete: Import & Unify

Step 8 is now fully shipped — Claude Code import, claude.ai import, fork continuity, and metadata framework. Klatch is now the single place where your Claude interactions live.

### Added
- **Phase 2 — Fork continuity**: Continue imported conversations with full context. Anthropic Compaction API integration for automatic summarization. CLAUDE.md context loading, session summary injection. History cap and empty message filtering for imported channels.
- **Phase 3 — claude.ai import**: Parse claude.ai ZIP data exports. Maps conversations to channels, extracts artifacts. Reuses Phase 1 import patterns.
- **Step 8½ — Metadata framework**: `getChannelStats()` returns message counts, artifact counts, tool breakdown per channel. `getAllChannelsEnriched()` enriched channel list with activity metadata. Sidebar project grouping — imported channels grouped by project (from `cwd` in source metadata), collapsible sections. Stats UI card in channel settings.
- **Import hardening**: Path traversal protection, file size limits, skip reporting for malformed events. 10 new hardening tests.
- **Multi-agent coordination**: Theseus Prime (manual testing) and Ariadne (forked Klatch-side perspective) added to the team. Session logs in `docs/logs/`.

### Fixed
- **Auth with Claude for Mac**: Claude for Mac sets `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""` in the child process environment. Dotenv's default is to not overwrite existing vars, so the `.env` file's valid key was silently ignored. Fixed with `override: true`.
- **6 bugs from Phase 2 live testing**: Fixed during integration pass (see `af80e48`).
- **Channel auto-naming**: Scan past queue-operation events to find `cwd` for imported channel names.

### Changed
- Channel list endpoint now returns enriched data (message counts, last activity).
- Roadmap updated: Step 9 is now Search & Recall (promoted), Step 10 is Files & Artifacts (deferred). Step 8¾ import refinements added as pre-Step 9 polish checkpoint.
- COORDINATION.md protocol now includes timestamp convention.

### Technical
- 266 tests passing (260 server + 6 client). 70 new tests since v0.8.1.
- New routes: `/api/import/claude-ai`, `/api/channels/:id/stats`
- New queries: `getAllChannelsEnriched()`, `getChannelStats()`
- Compaction state stored per-channel as JSON in `compaction_state` column
- Sidebar `useMemo` grouping with `Map<string, {name, channels[]}>` for O(n) project clustering

## [0.8.1] — 2026-03-10

### Step 8 Phase 1: Bug Fixes

Three bugs discovered during import testing and demo recording, all fixed.

### Fixed
- **Parser turn detection**: real Claude Code sessions form a linked list (`parentUuid` chains from each response to the next), not a tree with multiple roots. Only the very first event has `parentUuid=null`. Replaced root-detection with `isHumanTurnBoundary()` which identifies turn boundaries by finding user events with actual text content (vs system-injected `tool_result` blocks). A 5,365-event session now correctly produces 67 turns instead of 1.
- **Roundtable SSE race condition**: when the client opened an SSE connection for roundtable entities 2+, the in-memory emitter didn't exist yet (entity hadn't started streaming). The endpoint incorrectly treated "no emitter" as "already completed." Now checks DB status — if still `streaming` with no emitter, polls (200ms interval, 2-minute timeout) until the emitter appears or DB status changes.
- **ESM import hoisting / Anthropic auth failure**: `new Anthropic()` was called at module load time, before `dotenv.config()` ran in the server entrypoint (ESM hoists all `import` statements before module body code). Replaced with lazy-init `getAnthropicClient()` that defers construction to first use.

### Technical
- `isHumanTurnBoundary()` exported from parser for testability
- `groupIntoTurns()` rewritten: chronological boundary detection instead of BFS from parentUuid roots
- Demo seed script for mystery-menu roundtable (`scripts/seed-demo.ts`)
- **196 tests passing** (unchanged)

## [0.8.0] — 2026-03-09

### Step 8 Phase 1: Claude Code Import

Klatch can now import Claude Code JSONL sessions — the first step toward becoming the single pane of glass for all Claude interactions.

### Added
- **JSONL parser**: walks the `parentUuid` tree, extracts text turns, collapses tool-use into human-readable summaries. Classifies subagents by type (task/compaction/prompt_suggestion), extracts compaction summaries.
- **Import API**: `POST /api/import/claude-code` accepts a session file path, creates a channel with messages and artifacts. Dedup detection returns 409 if the session was already imported.
- **Message artifacts table**: `message_artifacts` stores tool-use, thinking, and image blocks at full fidelity with `tool_name` and `input_summary` columns for display.
- **Schema migration**: `source` and `source_metadata` on channels, `original_timestamp` and `original_id` on messages, new `message_artifacts` table with CASCADE delete.
- **Import UI**: sidebar import button, session path input modal, optional channel name, loading/error/success states, navigate to imported channel on completion.
- **Source badges**: "CC" badge on imported channels in sidebar. Import provenance section in channel settings (project, import date, event count, Claude Code version).
- **Auto-naming**: imported channels named `{project} — {YYYY-MM-DD}` from working directory and timestamp.
- 46 new tests: parser (23), import API (10), migration (18 total, 9 new). **196 tests passing**.
- Multi-agent coordination: Argus wrote test infrastructure (836 lines) defining parser and import API contracts; Daedalus implemented to match.

### Changed
- `createChannel` return value now includes `source: 'native'` for type consistency
- Architecture decision log updated through Step 8

## [0.7.0] — 2026-03-09

### Step 7: Interaction Modes

Three ways to orchestrate multi-entity conversations, plus sidebar grouping and entity handles.

### Added
- **Mode selector** in channel settings: panel, roundtable, directed
- **Roundtable mode**: entities respond sequentially, each seeing all prior responses in the round. Shared context builds a genuine discussion.
- **Directed mode**: @-mention routes messages to specific entities. Supports `@Name`, `@handle`, and `@"Quoted Name"` syntax.
- **@-mention autocomplete** in message input (directed mode): type `@` to see entity list, keyboard navigation, handle display
- **Entity handles** (slugs): optional short identifier per entity (e.g., `exec`, `cxo`). Used for quick @-mentions and displayed in UI.
- **Sidebar grouping**: channels split into **Roles** (@prefix, 1 entity) and **Channels** (#prefix, 2+ entities), inspired by Slack/Discord DM vs channel paradigm
- `parseMentions()` and `resolveMentions()` shared utilities for @-mention parsing
- `entityCount` on Channel type, computed via LEFT JOIN for sidebar grouping
- 36 new tests: mention parsing (24), directed mode API (4), sidebar grouping (4), entity handle CRUD (4). Total: **154 tests passing**.
- Mode-aware regenerate: regenerates using the correct mode's orchestration logic
- Hide mode selector for single-entity channels (only one mode makes sense)

### Changed
- Roundtable abort cleanup: all in-flight streams abort when any entity errors
- Website refreshed: light theme, updated roadmap, mentions both Claude agents

## [0.6.0] — 2026-03-08

### Step 6: Multi-Entity Conversations

The first feature impossible in claude.ai or Claude Code. Multiple Claude personas in one channel.

### Added
- **Entities**: named Claude personas with model, system prompt, and avatar color
- Entity CRUD API and management UI (create, edit, delete, color picker)
- Assign up to 5 entities per channel
- N parallel streams per user message (panel mode)
- Entity-aware message display: colored avatars, entity names, model labels
- Channel header shows entity pills with colored dots
- Channel system prompt becomes shared preamble prepended to each entity's prompt
- `channel_entities` join table for entity-channel assignments
- Default entity auto-assigned to new channels
- Backward compatible: single-entity channels look and work identically to before

### Infrastructure
- Multi-agent coordination protocol (`docs/COORDINATION.md`): Daedalus (architecture) + Argus (quality)
- Test count: 62 → 118
- CC BY 4.0 license
