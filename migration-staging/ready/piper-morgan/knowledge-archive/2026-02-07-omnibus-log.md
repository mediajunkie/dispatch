# Omnibus Session Log: February 7, 2026 (Saturday)

## Day Overview

A lighter Saturday with PM still recovering from a cold. The day centered on two themes: Chief of Staff transition to Opus 4.6 (new 1M token context window) and a comprehensive 4-hour HOSR session clearing human relations backlog. The Docs agent synthesized the Feb 6 omnibus, the outgoing Chief of Staff prepared a handoff memo for successor, and a new Chief of Staff session began with Opus 4.6 orientation. The HOSR session created detailed profiles for Ted Nadeau and Cindy Chastain, established a flexible profile template system, and extracted 14 GitHub issues from Ted's Windows bug report.

**Format**: Standard Day (4 sessions, relationship management focus)
**Day Rating**: RELATIONSHIP-MANAGEMENT + TRANSITION (human network, Chief of Staff handoff)

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Chief of Staff Transition to Opus 4.6

Anthropic released Opus 4.6 this week with 1 million token context window. PM initiated migration:

| Phase | Actor | Deliverable |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Handoff prep | Outgoing CoS | `handoff-memo-exec-2026-02-07.md` |
| Orientation | New CoS (Opus 4.6) | Read briefing, omnibus, Ship #029 |
| Continuation | New CoS | Session log started, pending items carried |

**5 weeks of collaboration** (Jan 3 - Feb 7) summarized in handoff:
- Daily check-in cadence established
- 5-workstream review structure developed
- Weekly Ship synthesis process (template v3 â†’ v4)
- Navigated MUX planning â†’ implementation â†’ M0 readiness
- Pattern catalog grew 50 â†’ 61, organized into 8 families

### 2. Human Network Management (HOSR)

Comprehensive 4-hour session cleared relationship management backlog:

**Full Profiles Created**:
| Person | Roles | Key Context |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Ted Nadeau | Advisor + Alpha Tester | 44-year friendship, MultiChat POC, ADR contributions, Windows testing |
| Cindy Chastain | Collaborator + Advisor | Podcast prep, documentary approach, Experience Themes framework |

**Quick-Tracked (9 relationships)**:
- Nancy Wright White (self-selected out)
- Rick Levy (just introduced)
- Magdaline/Dominique Derosena (postponed)
- Dave Feldman (timezone stalled)
- Tony Brancato (busy with Charlie.com)
- Luca Candela (needs follow-up)
- Christina Wodtke (waiting for hosted)
- Matt LeMay (in orbit)
- Komal Rasheed (needs follow-up)
- Justin Maxwell (awaiting cofounder email)

**Profile Template System**:
- Core Profile (required for all humans)
- Role Extensions for flexibility (multiple roles normal)
- Addresses variety: testers, advisors, collaborators, amplifiers

### 3. Ted Nadeau Windows Issues

Extracted 14 GitHub issues from Ted's E1-E30 Windows bug report:

| Priority | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Blocker | 2 |
| High | 3 |
| Medium | 6 |
| Low | 5 |

Issues documented in `ted-nadeau-windows-issues-2026-02-07.md` for future filing.

### 4. Feb 6 Omnibus Synthesized

Docs Agent synthesized HIGH-VELOCITY + SHIP-SYNTHESIS day:
- 8 source logs (1,150 lines) â†’ ~380 line omnibus
- Ship #029 synthesis, Cathedral Context vision doc, alpha bug cascade, v0.8.5.2 release

---

## GitHub Activity

No issues created or closed on Feb 7. (14 Windows issues documented for future filing.)

---

## Patterns & Observations

### Continuity Infrastructure Validated Again

Outgoing Chief of Staff noted: "The infrastructure we built together means transitions like this can happen smoothly. That's the cathedral at work."

The handoff memo demonstrates Pattern-021 (Development Session Management) at the role level â€” explicit context transfer enabling successor to continue without loss.

### Cognitive Load Relief

PM noted the HOSR session provided "huge weight off" from conveying relationship management context. This validates the profile system as addressing real coordination overhead â€” PM no longer needs to hold all human network context in working memory.

### Profile Template Flexibility

The role extension system (Alpha Tester, Advisor, Contributor, Collaborator, Amplifier) allows one person to hold multiple roles without forcing everyone into a single template. Ted Nadeau = Advisor + Alpha Tester + (future) Contributor.
