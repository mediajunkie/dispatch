## Key Themes

### 1. Timezone Bug Discovery and Resolution

Lead Dev discovered a **systemic timezone bug** while fixing test failures:

**Root Cause**: Files uploaded are stored with UTC timestamps in PostgreSQL, but `datetime.now()` (naive local time) was used for comparison. This made all files appear "from the future," giving them maximum recency scores regardless of actual age.

**Investigation Path**:
- #756 (test bug) â†’ #757 (discovered actual bug) â†’ #768 (systemic audit)

**Findings**: Only 3 real bugs (not 10+ initially feared):
- `file_resolver.py` - recency and usage scoring
- `context_tracker.py` - conversation age calculation

**Fix**: Created `services/utils/datetime_utils.py` with `utc_now_naive()` helper function.

**Result**: All three issues (#756, #757, #768) closed. File scoring now works correctly in production.

### 2. Weekly Documentation Audit

Docs Management executed the weekly audit (#761):
- 60 patterns verified (README accurate)
- 1,061 docs, 103MB total
- Infrastructure healthy
- Roadmap v14 moved to proper location
- ~54 stale issues identified (but most are scheduled for later sprints)

### 3. File Housekeeping

Major cleanup of `dev/active/`:
- Created `docs/internal/planning/conversational-glue/` (8 files)
- Created `docs/internal/planning/mobile-skunkworks/`
- Archived ~30 files to dated folders
- Updated NAVIGATION.md

### 4. Workstream Alignment

Chief of Staff reviewed Product & Experience and Engineering workstreams:
- Confirmed M0 issues created (#762-767)
- Confirmed multi-tenancy sufficient for alpha (#759)
- Identified need for Gate issue language (memo drafted for Architect)
- Ship #028 confirmed for Wednesday publication

## Decisions Made

1. **Timezone fix approach**: Create utility function, fix 3 real bugs (not 10+)
2. **#756 resolution**: Test bug, not code bug - fixed test expectation
3. **#760 timing**: Can defer until adding second alpha tester
4. **Gate issue language**: Chief Architect to draft for M0-M6 sprints
5. **Ship #028**: Confirmed for Wednesday publication

---

## Blockers/Concerns

None. Alpha bug queue significantly reduced. E2E testing continues this afternoon.

---

## Tomorrow's Focus

- Continue E2E alpha testing
- Complete workstream review (Methodology, External Relations, Governance)
- Await Architect response on Gate issue language
- Clarify HOSR logging continuity recommendation

---

## Day Rating Rationale

**STANDARD**: Productive but focused day. Bug fixing continued with a notable timezone discovery, but the scope was contained (3 real bugs, not systemic crisis). Documentation audit was routine. Chief of Staff aligned workstreams and captured actions. No multi-agent coordination complexity or major architectural decisions.
