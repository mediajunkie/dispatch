# Omnibus Log: February 12, 2026

**Synthesized**: February 13, 2026
**Source Logs**: 4
**Day Rating**: QUALITY-FOCUSED (Narrative Verification + Windows CI + Process Discipline)

---

## Day Overview

A Thursday balancing quality discipline with reactive bug fixing. The morning saw parallel work: Comms Director fact-checked a blog draft and discovered systematic confabulation patterns, leading to a new Narrative Verification Skill; Docs created the Feb 11 omnibus and summarized 22 unpublished insight drafts for publication planning; Chief of Staff caught up on Feb 10-11 progress. The afternoon brought an urgent Windows bugâ€”Dominique Derosena's setup script failed immediatelyâ€”which Lead Developer traced to a pre-existing batch file bug from December 2025. This triggered a broader Windows testing gap analysis and the creation of Windows CI infrastructure.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Narrative Confabulation Discovery & Skill Creation

Comms Director fact-checked "The Drift We Didn't See" draft against source logs and discovered **systematic fabrication**:

| Claim in Draft | Actual per Logs | Status |
|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| "file scoring bug" as trigger | Todo bug + timezone warnings | FABRICATED |
| "73 database columns" | 47 DateTime columns | WRONG |
| "Three days of investigation" | One day (Feb 1) | WRONG |
| Alembic migration hash | Not in logs | FABRICATED |
| "utc_now_naive()" function | Different functions in code | WRONG |

**Pattern identified**: Narrative drafting under story-completion pressure leads to:
1. **Inversion of causality** - Side discoveries repositioned as triggers
2. **Plausible but wrong specifics** - Numbers, timelines fabricated
3. **Narrative smoothing** - Details invented for flow

**Solution**: Created `skill-narrative-verification-v1.md`:
- Pre-draft facts extraction (cite before you write)
- Verification checkpoint (check claims before delivery)
- Red flags for common fabrication patterns
- Core principle: "Placeholders are safeguards, not clutter"

### 2. Insights Summary Index for Comms

Docs Management created comprehensive summary index for 22 unpublished insight drafts:

| Status | Count |
|--------|-------|
| READY (publishable as-is) | 2 |
| HAS-PLACEHOLDERS (PM input needed) | 20 |

**Thematic groupings created**:
- Architecture & Design Principles (4 pieces)
- Process & Methodology (6 pieces)
- Human-AI Collaboration (4 pieces)
- Building in Public / Candid Struggles (8 pieces)

**Weekend selections made**:
- Feb 14-15: Investigation as Investment + Analysis as Acceleration
- Feb 21-22: The Forcing Function + Upstream Coordination

**Process note**: Docs failed to create session log at session start (created retroactively at 6:10 PM after PM noticed). Ironic given the role.

### 3. Windows Batch File Bug Fix

Dominique Derosena testing v0.8.5.3 on Windowsâ€”setup script failed immediately.

**Root Cause**: Pre-existing bug in `alpha-setup.bat` from December 2025. `exit /b` inside helper subroutines caused immediate script termination instead of returning to caller.

**Why not caught in Ted Nadeau's testing**: Ted's 14 issues focused on requirements.txt, migrations, docsâ€”likely switched to manual setup when script failed.

**Fix applied** (commit `432e0ebf`):
- Restructured script: main code first, helpers after
- Changed `exit /b` to `goto :eof` in subroutines
- Updated `docker-compose` to `docker compose`
- Updated `localhost` to `127.0.0.1` for IPv6 compatibility

### 4. Windows CI Infrastructure

Gap analysis revealed no automated Windows testing existed.

**Created** (commit `183aaea8`):

1. **`.github/workflows/windows-test.yml`**
   - Runs on `windows-latest`
   - Triggered on: requirements.txt, *.bat, *.ps1, validate_install.py
   - Smoke tests + unit tests (excluding LLM/integration)

2. **`scripts/windows-smoke-test.bat`**
   - Manual validation script for Windows alpha testers
   - Tests: Python, venv, imports, uvloop, main.py, Docker

**CI Status**: âœ… PASSING (run ID: 21963988714)

### 5. Feb 11 Omnibus Created

Docs synthesized two session logs into omnibus capturing:
- Critical file recovery (2,781 files from git history)
- ADR link audit (7 broken links fixed)
- dev/ cleanup (5.1 GB â†’ 1.2 GB)
- Ted Nadeau Windows mini-sprint (14 issues)
- v0.8.5.3 release

## Patterns & Observations

### The Confabulation Pattern

This is the second blog post (after "The Calendar That Wasn't Mine") where narrative details were fabricated. The pattern is consistent:
- Pressure to create clean story arc
- Without explicit source verification, narrative fills gaps with plausible fabrication
- Technical specifics (numbers, hashes, function names) particularly vulnerable

The new skill addresses this with "cite before you write" discipline.

### The Cascade of Untested Code

The batch file bug existed since December 2025 but wasn't caught because:
1. No automated tests for the script
2. Previous testing used different paths
3. The script structure looked correct

Ted's testing was reactive (hit errors, report them) rather than systematic (verify complete journey). The batch script failing immediately likely caused testers to switch to manual setup.

**Process improvement**: Windows CI now catches this class of bug automatically.

### Session Log Protocol Enforcement

Docs agent failed to create session log despite:
- Protocol being in CLAUDE.md
- Having a skill for it
- Just having synthesized two session logs into an omnibus

PM's explicit "please make a session log" prompt at session start acts as a forcing function. The protocol in CLAUDE.md competes with the immediate task; the explicit prompt moves it to foreground.

## Tomorrow's Focus

1. **Weekend Insight Publication** - Investigation as Investment + Analysis as Acceleration
2. **Ship #030 Format Discussion** - Tightening length
3. **Dominique Follow-up** - Verify Windows setup working
4. **Michelle/Justin Alpha** - Engagement and onboarding

*Day rating: QUALITY-FOCUSED â€” Two significant quality improvements: narrative verification discipline for blog posts, Windows CI preventing untested code paths. Both emerged from discovering gaps (confabulated content, failing script) and building systematic prevention. Also: Docs agent learned that knowing the value of session logs doesn't equal creating them.*
