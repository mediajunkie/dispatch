## Day Summary

Friday evening leadership weekly review session. PM recovering from flu (day 7+), light day due to illness + busy day at work (VA production bug). Chief of Staff gathered Ship #030 workstream draft from Feb 6-12 omnibus logs, then circulated to 6 leadership voices for feedback. Full consensus analysis completed.

---

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Ship #030 Workstream Review Completed

Chief of Staff created `ship-030-workstream-draft.md` covering all 5 workstreams from Feb 6-12 omnibus logs (~3,200 source lines across ~22 sessions). Draft included:
- Day-by-day ratings table
- Comprehensive workstream coverage
- PM fill-in spots marked
- 4 open questions posed for leadership

### 2. Full Leadership Feedback Cycle

All 6 leadership voices responded:

**Theme Vote Tally**:
| Theme | Votes | Supporters |
|-------|-------|------------|
| "The Infrastructure Holds" | 3 | PPM, HOSR, CXO |
| "The Cathedral in Winter" | 2 | CIO, Comms |
| "The Cathedral Holds" | 1 | Architect |

â†’ "The Cathedral Holds" emerged as potential bridge

**Learning Pattern Vote Tally**:
| Pattern | Votes | Supporters |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Infrastructure resilience | 3 | PPM, Comms, Architect |
| Narrative Verification | 3 | HOSR, CXO, CIO |

â†’ 3-3 split, PM tiebreaker needed (or use both)

**Ship Length Consensus**: Universal agreement to tighten
- Executive summary/TL;DR at top
- Section limits (~1,200 words external)
- Metrics to appendix
- Cut duplicative content

### 3. Factual Corrections Identified

Multiple leadership voices flagged corrections needed:
- Feb 9 = Monday (not Sunday)
- Issues closed = ~33 (not ~27)
- Test suite count: clarify 5200+ vs 5268
- Dominique = Magdaline's referral (not Justin Maxwell's)

### 4. Content Additions Surfaced

Leadership identified missing/underweighted items:
- History Sidebar â†’ full methodology win framing (PPM + CXO)
- Session bleed â†’ P0 security callout (PPM + Architect)
- TUG "warranted trust" + IA Conference groundwork (CIO)
- Blog publication dates (Comms)
- HOSR deliverables (Jake profile, template, Ted memo, distribution list)

## Leadership Perspectives

### PPM (Principal Product Manager)
- **Theme**: "The Infrastructure Holds"
- **Learning**: Infrastructure resilience during PM illness
- **Key add**: Don't undersell History Sidebar resolution; M0 status update needed
- **Concern**: M0 start date slipping

### HOSR (Head of Sapient Resources)
- **Theme**: "The Infrastructure Holds"
- **Learning**: Narrative Verification (most novel, reusable artifact)
- **Key insight**: Human network expanding appropriately for this phase
- **Concern**: Two Windows testers both blocked by platform bugs

### CIO (Chief Innovation Officer)
- **Theme**: "The Cathedral in Winter" (methodology as immune system)
- **Learning**: Narrative Verification â€” named the meta-pattern "Story Completion Pressure"
- **Key insight**: Ethical Pattern Portability concept worth tracking
- **Observation**: Story Completion Pressure is generalizable beyond Piper

### Comms (Communications Director)
- **Theme**: "The Cathedral in Winter" (narrative resonance)
- **Learning**: Infrastructure resilience (flu week is proof case)
- **Narrative hook**: "What happens when the person building the cathedral gets sick?"
- **Key add**: Blog dates, IA Conference mention, insight piece preview

### CXO (Chief Experience Officer)
- **Theme**: "The Infrastructure Holds" (alt: "Cathedral Under Load")
- **Learning**: Narrative Verification (most novel, transferable, clear action)
- **Key insight**: History Sidebar was cathedral-blindness intervention
- **Question**: Is website implementation production-ready?

### Architect (Chief Architect)
- **Theme**: "The Cathedral Holds" (bridge between camps)
- **Learning**: Infrastructure resilience (most distinctive, actionable)
- **Key add**: Session bleed was P0 security; schema audit recommended
- **Offer**: Draft TL;DR or expanded engineering section

## Methodology Observations

### CIO: Story Completion Pressure
Named a generalizable pattern: when agents draft content under narrative pressure (making a story flow), they:
- Invert causality (side discoveries become triggers)
- Fabricate plausible specifics (numbers, timelines)
- Smooth over gaps with invented details

Response: "Placeholders are safeguards, not clutter" â€” belongs in pattern catalog.

### Comms: Cathedral Framing
Narrative framing for public version:
> "What happens when the person building the cathedral gets sick? This week we found out: the cathedral keeps building itself. Not because it's autonomous, but because we built the infrastructureâ€”the logs, the protocols, the agent coordinationâ€”that lets work continue without heroic individual effort."

## Next Steps

1. PM decision on theme (likely "The Cathedral Holds" as bridge)
2. PM tiebreaker on learning pattern (resilience vs verification)
3. Saturday discussion (Feb 14) â€” general + Ship #030 finalization
4. Incorporate factual corrections and content additions
