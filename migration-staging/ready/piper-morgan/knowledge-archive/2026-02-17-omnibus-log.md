**Day**: Tuesday
**Sessions**: 2
**Day Rating**: **EXECUTION** (3 M0 Issues Completed)
**Synthesized**: February 18, 2026

## Executive Summary

A focused development day. The Lead Developer completed three M0 sprint issues (#763, #765, #764), adding 323 tests total. M0 is now 4/6 complete â€” the conversational glue is taking shape. Late evening, Docs synthesized the complex Feb 16 omnibus (9 sessions).

**Key outcomes**:
- **#763 GLUE-FOLLOWUP complete**: Conversational lens tracking with rule-based + LLM decoder â€” "Piper has short-term memory again"
- **#765 GLUE-SLOTFILL complete**: Declarative slot-filling framework integrated with ProcessRegistry
- **#764 GLUE-MULTIINTENT complete**: Intent orchestration handles 2+ substantive intents in one message
- **Feb 16 omnibus created**: 9-session synthesis captured complex coordination day

## Issue #763: GLUE-FOLLOWUP (Lens Tracking)

**Problem**: Follow-up queries like "What about Thursday?" after a calendar question had no context â€” Piper asked "Thursday... what?"

**Solution**: Conversational lens tracking with inheritance

| Phase | Description | Tests |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | ConversationContext extension + 44-pair test corpus | 58 |
| 2 | Lens extraction + rule-based enhancement | 42 |
| 3 | LLM lens decoder for complex follow-ups | 23 |
| 4 | Lens reset + stack + edge cases | 20 |
| 5 | Colleague test + regression | 9 |
| **Total** | | **152** |

**New infrastructure**:
- `ConversationalLens` enum (CALENDAR, ISSUES, PROJECTS, PEOPLE, GENERAL)
- `lens_stack` + `current_lens` on ConversationContext
- `lens_inference.py`: extraction, inheritance, LLM decoder, reset detection
- Hybrid approach: rules for simple patterns (50% baseline), LLM for complex

**Milestone note**: "Piper has short-term memory again. The conversational glue is starting to hold."

**Commit**: `a0f87773`

## Issue #765: GLUE-SLOTFILL (Slot Filling Framework)

**Problem**: Multi-parameter requests like "Schedule a meeting with Sarah Tuesday at 2pm" required tedious back-and-forth questioning.

**Solution**: Declarative slot-filling framework with multi-slot extraction

| Phase | Description | Tests |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | SlotTemplate + SlotFillingState data model | 34 |
| 2 | Slot extraction + skip logic | 54 |
| 3 | SlotFillingManager + ProcessRegistry integration | 30 |
| 4 | Colleague test + regression | 6 |
| **Total** | | **124** |

**New package**: `services/slot_filling/`
- `slot_template.py`: SlotType, SlotDefinition, SlotTemplate, SlotState
- `slot_extractor.py`: LLM-based multi-slot extraction
- `slot_prompts.py`: Natural-language grouped prompting
- `slot_filling_manager.py`: State machine (EXTRACTING â†’ PROMPTING â†’ CONFIRMING â†’ COMPLETE)
- `slot_filling_adapter.py`: GuidedProcess protocol adapter

**Integration**: ProcessType.SLOT_FILLING (priority 25) in ProcessRegistry

**Commit**: `fb574c58`

## Issue #764: GLUE-MULTIINTENT (Intent Orchestration)

**Problem**: "What's on my calendar and what are my top priorities?" â€” second intent silently dropped.

**Solution**: Intent orchestrator executes multiple substantive intents and aggregates responses

| Phase | Description | Tests |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | IntentOrchestrator + ExecutionPlan + aggregation | 33 |
| 3 | IntentService integration | 8 |
| 4 | Colleague test + regression | 6 |
| **Total** | | **47** |

**New infrastructure**:
- `orchestrator.py`: IntentOrchestrator, ExecutionPlan, OrchestratedResponse
- ExecutionStrategy (PARALLEL, SEQUENTIAL) with MAX_INTENTS=4 cap
- Natural transition phrases in aggregation
- Partial failure handling (success with note)

**Integration**: IntentService routes 2+ substantive intents to orchestrator path

**Commit**: `4a088e78`

## Docs: Feb 16 Omnibus

Synthesized the 9-session President's Day log into omnibus #255:
- Morning leadership burst (7 agents, 6:35-8:05 AM)
- Spec Agent Claude Hooks evaluation
- 11-hour Lead Developer session (#766 complete, #763 gameplan)
- 6 themes: M0 kickoff, methodology-product convergence, distribution model debate, content strategy, Claude Hooks, context pressure pattern

---

## Tests Added

| Issue | Tests Added |
|-------|-------------|
| #763 | 152 |
| #765 | 124 |
| #764 | 47 |
| **Total** | **323** |

**Regression**: All green. 1 pre-existing failure (#813, unrelated).

## Branch Status

**Branch**: `claude/m0-conversational-glue`
**Commits**: 5 total (#766, #815, #763, #765, #764)
**Pushed**: Yes

---

## Handoff for Feb 18

**Next**: #767 GLUE-SOFTINVOKE (soft invocations like "remind me" or "set up a meeting")
- Depends on #764 (multi-intent) and #765 (slot-filling) â€” both complete
- Last issue before #779

**M0 sequence**: #766 âœ… â†’ #763 âœ… â†’ #765 âœ… â†’ #764 âœ… â†’ **#767** â†’ #779

---

## Day Assessment

**Complexity**: Low (focused execution)
**Productivity**: Very High (3 issues closed, 323 tests added)
**Quality**: High (colleague tests passed, proper issue closures, audit cascades applied)

**Standout**: The Lead Developer's session demonstrated sustained execution velocity â€” audit cascade â†’ gameplan â†’ implementation â†’ colleague test â†’ close, repeated three times. M0 is 67% complete after two days of focused work.
