## Theme 1: Documentation Audit & Maintenance

**Agent**: Docs Management Specialist

### Weekly Docs Audit (#791)

**Infrastructure Verification** (all passed):
- app.py: 283 lines (well under 1000 threshold)
- Cursor rules: 5 files present
- Pattern count: 61 files matches README
- ADR naming: all lowercase

**Key Finding**: BRIEFING-CURRENT-STATE.md was stale (13 days old)
- Pattern count said 60 (should be 61)
- Version said v0.8.5 (should be v0.8.5.2)
- Missing Feb 1-8 progress

**Resolution**: Comprehensive refresh of BRIEFING-CURRENT-STATE.md with:
- Status banner: Position 4.4, v0.8.5.2
- Recent progress table (Feb 1-8): ~44 issues closed
- System capability: 61 patterns, 61 ADRs, 8 pattern families
- M0 Conversational Glue Sprint planning section

**Metrics Snapshot**:
- Total docs: 1,089 markdown files
- Python LOC: 1,319,865
- TODO/FIXME comments: 117

**Staggered Calendar Updated**:
- Documentation Audit: Last Completed â†’ Feb 9, 2026
- Next Due â†’ Mar 9, 2026

### Skill Improvement: close-issue-properly v1.1

**Failure Mode Observed**: Agent closed issue #791 with comment only, leaving description checkboxes unchecked (Comment-Only Close anti-pattern).

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Step 2 (Update Description) wasn't emphasized enough
- No mandatory gate between reading issue and commenting
- Examples showed comment in detail but hand-waved description update

**Skill Updated** (`.claude/skills/close-issue-properly/SKILL.md`):
- Added Pre-Flight Checklist with CRITICAL warning
- Expanded Step 2 to "Analyze the Description (MANDATORY)"
- Added explicit warning before Step 4 about anti-pattern
- Added "Unexplained unchecked boxes" to anti-patterns table
- New Stop Condition: "You haven't updated the description checkboxes"
- Improved all examples to show full flow

**Pattern**: This is Pattern-049 (Audit at Phase Boundaries) in action - the failure led to immediate skill improvement.

## Theme 2: Website Redesign Implementation

**Agent**: Web Developer (Code Opus)

### Context

CXO and Comms completed full website content/IA work over the weekend (Feb 8):
- New sitemap with `/try` branching flow
- Full 7-page content draft
- Approved hero: "THINK BIGGER / Piper holds the threads so you can focus on the decision"

### Implementation (5 Phases Complete)

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Foundation (Navigation interface, ClientRedirect) | âœ… |
| 2 | New Pages (/try, /try/alpha, /try/beta, /methodology) | âœ… |
| 3 | Navigation Update (dropdown, emphasis) | âœ… |
| 4 | Redirects (/how-it-works â†’ /methodology, /newsletter â†’ /try/beta) | âœ… |
| 5 | Content Updates (Homepage, About, Get Involved) | âœ… |

### Files Created
- `src/components/atoms/ClientRedirect.tsx`
- `src/app/try/page.tsx`
- `src/app/try/alpha/page.tsx`
- `src/app/try/beta/page.tsx`
- `src/app/methodology/page.tsx`

### Files Modified
- `src/components/Navigation.tsx` - Major rewrite with dropdown support
- `src/components/Footer.tsx` - Updated links
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Complete homepage rewrite
- `src/app/about/page.tsx` - New content structure
- `src/app/get-involved/page.tsx` - Contributor focus
- Redirect conversions for `/how-it-works` and `/newsletter`

### Technical Decisions
- **Form handling**: Formspree (simpler than ConvertKit)
- **`/what-weve-learned`**: Keep page, remove from nav only
- **Playbook**: Hidden in nav until content ready

### Safety
- Pre-redesign snapshot tagged: `pre-redesign-2026-02-09` at commit `9fcec448`
- Can restore with: `git checkout pre-redesign-2026-02-09`

### Remaining Work
- Set up Formspree form ID (replace placeholder)
- Test redirects in production
- Verify mobile dropdown behavior
- PM review and styling adjustments

## Cross-Session Patterns

### Pattern: Weekend Strategy â†’ Weekday Implementation
The CXO/Comms weekend work (Feb 8) on website strategy was immediately implemented (Feb 9). This rapid follow-through demonstrates the value of having complete content/copy ready before implementation begins.

### Pattern: Failure â†’ Skill Improvement
The Comment-Only Close failure on #791 led directly to skill v1.1 improvements. Meta-learning captured and institutionalized within the same session.
