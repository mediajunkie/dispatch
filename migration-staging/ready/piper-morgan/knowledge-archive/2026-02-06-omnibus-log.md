# Omnibus Session Log: February 6, 2026 (Friday)

## Day Overview

A landmark day combining intensive bug fixing with strategic coordination. The morning opened with a full leadership rotation â€” 8 agents submitted weekly memos for Ship #029 covering Jan 30-Feb 5. Meanwhile, Lead Dev spent 9 hours fixing alpha testing bugs, triggered by a seemingly simple History Sidebar redundancy issue that cascaded into discovery of 5 interconnected bugs including cross-user session bleed. CXO and CIO collaborated to create a "Cathedral Context" vision document preventing future cathedral blindness. The day culminated in v0.8.5.2 release with all 4 alpha bugs fixed.

**Format**: High-Complexity Day (8 sessions, parallel coordination + deep debugging)
**Day Rating**: HIGH-VELOCITY + SHIP-SYNTHESIS (13 issues closed, 1 release, weekly ship drafted)

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Ship #029 Synthesis ("The Foundation Hardens")

All 6 leadership roles submitted weekly memos covering Jan 30 - Feb 5:

| Role | Key Contribution | Assessment |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| **Chief Architect** | 57+ issues, multi-tenancy + timezone systemic fixes | Engineering ready for M0 |
| **CIO** | Pattern Sweep 2.0 (50â†’61), Pattern-060, family operationalization | "Patterns in Families" theme |
| **Communications** | 4 published, 4 drafted, ~10 day runway | Pipeline healthy |
| **CXO** | PDR-002 review (Recovery dimension, anti-robotics) | LIGHT-TO-MODERATE |
| **HOSR** | Role Health Check v1.0, 4 tester profiles, continuity validated | All roles healthy |
| **PPM** | M0 ready, 25+ alpha bugs closed, B2 Quality Gate | Inchworm 4.4.0 |

**Ship theme**: Infrastructure stabilization + methodology maturation enabling M0 readiness

### 2. Cathedral Context Vision Document

CXO and CIO collaborated to create prevention mechanism for "Cathedral Blindness" (building feature without design intent):

| Deliverable | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `PDR-002-appendix-layer-2-vision.md` | Layer 2 design intent for implementers |
| Vision doc template | Reusable pattern for multi-component PDRs |
| Cathedral Context paragraph | Added to issues #425, #706, #785 |
| Bidirectional linking | Vision â†” Issues with forcing question |

**Forcing question**: "How does my implementation embody Layer 2's purpose â€” surfacing accumulated knowledge, not just showing older conversations?"

### 3. Alpha Bug Cascade (#786-789)

Lead Dev 9-hour session uncovered interconnected bugs through cascade investigation:

| Issue | Problem | Root Cause | Fix |
|-------|---------|------------|-----|
| #786 | History = Conversation (redundant) | Missing differentiation | Search + monthly grouping |
| #787 | Conversation not in sidebar | localStorage cross-user bleed | Clear on logout |
| #788 | Invalid Date display | `+00:00Z` invalid format | Replace not append |
| #789 | "No meetings" without calendar | Auth failure = empty calendar | calendar_connected flag |

**Cascade depth**: Simple redundancy issue â†’ API investigation â†’ 4 bugs â†’ 2 systemic fixes (localStorage, date formatting)

### 4. Release v0.8.5.2

Released to production branch for alpha testers:

- **Bugs fixed**: #786, #787, #788, #789
- **Pre-release fixes**: Timezone model alignment
- **Docs updated**: 6 alpha documentation files
- **Process**: Tag + GitHub release + production branch merge

## Patterns & Observations

### Cascade Investigation in Action

The #786-#789 sequence is a textbook Pattern-060 (Cascade Investigation):
1. **Trigger**: History Sidebar redundancy (#785 filed)
2. **Category audit**: Why do both sidebars show same data? â†’ API investigation
3. **Adjacent discovery**: #787 (data loss), #788 (date format), #789 (calendar)
4. **Deeper cascade**: #787 â†’ cross-user session bleed (localStorage)
5. **Resolution**: 4 fixes + 2 systemic improvements + 1 release

### Cathedral Blindness (Proto-Pattern Candidate)

CIO noted this as distinct from 75% Pattern:
- **75% Pattern**: Incomplete execution of the right thing
- **Cathedral Blindness**: Complete execution of the wrong thing due to missing design intent

The History Sidebar was "complete" (#425 marked done with 278 tests) but missed the Layer 2 vision entirely. Prevention mechanism: vision documents with forcing questions.

### Memo-Based Coordination Validated

CXO â†’ PPM memo exchange on sidebar visibility:
1. CXO argues visible-but-differentiated (not hide)
2. PPM revises position with new framing
3. Decision framework established (<2hr / 2-8hr / >1day)
4. Lead Dev estimate requested
5. #786 created and implemented same day

This is the mailbox system working as intended â€” respectful perspective exchange leading to aligned decision.
