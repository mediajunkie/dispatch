# Omnibus Log: February 1, 2026

**Synthesized**: February 2, 2026
**Source Logs**: 7
**Day Rating**: HIGH-VELOCITY (Alpha Bug Marathon + MVP Planning Deep Dive)

---

## Day Overview

A Sunday with two parallel tracks of intense work. Morning started with Lead Developer debugging a persistent todo bug, which cascaded into discovering and fixing 15+ issues including full timezone support across 80+ files. Simultaneously, PPM conducted comprehensive MVP roadmap planning with external research on conversational AI patterns, creating PDR-002 v3 and the M0 Conversational Glue sprint. Special Assignments performed design archaeology on the history sidebars and audited 18 old backlog issues. CXO and Architect provided stakeholder reviews of the glue documentation. Docs created the Jan 31 omnibus, fixed skills discoverability, and refactored alpha email templates.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Todo Feature Fixed (Finally!)

Lead Developer traced persistent "add todo" failures to root cause:

| Issue | Problem | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| #745 | `user_id="default"` hardcoded | Thread real user UUID through intent handlers |
| #748 | Spurious workflow polling | Remove `workflow_id` from todo response |

**Verification**: "I've added that to your list. 'write next scene of chapter one' is now tracked."

### 2. Full Timezone Support (#747)

Comprehensive datetime overhaul with 6 child issues:

| Child | Scope | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| #750 | `datetime_utils` module with TDD | âœ… CLOSED |
| #751 | 47 DateTime columns â†’ `timezone=True` | âœ… CLOSED |
| #752 | utcnow() in services/database/ | âœ… CLOSED |
| #753 | utcnow() in services/ | âœ… CLOSED |
| #754 | utcnow() in web/tests/ | âœ… CLOSED |
| #755 | Integration testing | âœ… CLOSED |

**Result**: 80+ files updated, 15 new tests, all datetime operations now timezone-aware.

### 3. Multi-Tenancy Migration Completed (#759)

Discovered 12 call sites missing `user_id` from #734 migration:

| Category | Files | Sites |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Plugin `is_configured()` | 4 | 4 |
| SlackClient | 1 | 3 |
| Webhook routers | 2 | 3 |
| Notion adapter | 1 | 1 |
| GitHub router | 1 | 1 |

**Solution**: Added `_get_connector_user_id()` pattern with env var fallback for system-level operations.

### 4. Knowledge Graph Fix (#749)

Root cause: SQLAlchemy `Enum(NodeType)` violated ADR-041 (use String in database).

**Fix**: Changed model columns to String with explicit enum conversion in `to_domain()`/`from_domain()`.

### 5. Conversational Glue Planning (PPM)

Comprehensive MVP roadmap work:

**External Research**:
- Stanford, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Rasa design patterns
- Production system analysis (Notion AI, Linear, Copilot)

**Deliverables Created**:
- PDR-002 v3.1 (Conversational Glue vision)
- `conversational-glue-implementation-guide.md` (~4500 words)
- `conversational-glue-gap-analysis.md` (39 requirements, 19 gaps)
- Roadmap v14.0 with M0-M6 sprint structure
- 5 M0 issue drafts (GLUE-FOLLOWUP, GLUE-MULTIINTENT, etc.)

**M0 Sprint Scope** (13-22 days):
| Issue | Focus | Effort |
|-------|-------|--------|
| GLUE-FOLLOWUP | Lens inheritance, ellipsis detection | 3-5d |
| GLUE-MULTIINTENT | Orchestration layer for compound queries | 3-5d |
| GLUE-SLOTFILL | Natural slot filling (not interrogation) | 3-5d |
| GLUE-MAINPROJ | Fix repeated "main project" question | 1-2d |
| GLUE-SOFTINVOKE | Soft workflow invocation | 3-5d |

### 6. Stakeholder Reviews

**CXO Review** (PDR-002):
- Added "Recovery" to B2 quality gate
- Added "Scripted Enthusiasm" and "Over-Explaining the Obvious" anti-patterns
- Sharpened persona: Piper as "junior peer proving themselves"
- Recommended post-M0 cross-functional review

**Architect Review** (M0 Technical Feasibility):
- âœ… Confidence scoring: FEASIBLE (3-5d)
- âœ… Multi-intent: Use orchestration layer (Option A)
- âœ… ConversationContextService: Facade pattern approved
- âš ï¸ ADR-054: NOT BUILT - defer to M1, do session-only for M0
- Verified #595 COMPLETE - reduces GLUE-MULTIINTENT effort

### 7. History Sidebar Archaeology

Special Assignments investigated PM's question about duplicate sidebars:

| Sidebar | Origin | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Left (#565) | CONV-PERSIST-3 | MVP conversation switching |
| Right (#425) | ADR-054/PDR-002 | Layer 2 User History (Three-Layer Model) |

**Finding**: Both currently show conversations (flattening detected). Right sidebar was designed for richer "User History" including entity surfacing (#706).

**Recommendation**: Option C - evolve right sidebar for entity/object surfacing post-MVP.

### 8. Backlog Freshness Audit

Special Assignments audited 18 old issues (#100-312):

| Action | Count | Issues |
|--------|-------|--------|
| CLOSE | 4 | #100, #101, #104, #106 (aspirational) |
| MERGE | 1 | #103 â†’ #496 |
| UPDATE | 5 | #118, #244, #272, #304, #312 |
| KEEP | 3 | #167, #190, #191 (test quality) |
| PM DECISION | 3 | #146-148 (methodology framework) |

### 9. Skills Discoverability Fixed

Docs investigated "Unknown skill" errors:

- **Initial hypothesis**: Context budget exceeded
- **Actual root cause**: PM launching Claude from wrong directory
- **Fix**: Skills in `.claude/skills/` are project-level - must launch from project root

### 10. Alpha Email Templates Refactored

Split combined template into separate files:
- `email-1-pre-qualification.md` (pure template)
- `email-2-confirmation.md` (pure template)
- `README.md` (instructions)

Updated disk space: 1GB â†’ 200MB (verified via shallow clone test).

## Patterns & Observations

### The Cascade Pattern

Lead Developer's morning debug session exemplifies productive cascading:
1. Todo bug â†’ discovered hardcoded `user_id`
2. Audit for similar issues â†’ found 6 more
3. Fix surfaced timezone warnings â†’ led to comprehensive overhaul
4. Timezone fix â†’ discovered 3 pre-existing test failures
5. Multi-tenancy audit â†’ found 12 incomplete migration sites

Each investigation revealed adjacent issues, all tracked and either fixed or filed.

### Anti-Flattening in Practice

CXO review caught potential flattening in M0 planning:
- 19 gaps is a lot for one sprint
- Added "Colleague Test" to every acceptance criterion
- Scheduled post-M0 cross-functional review

This operationalizes the anti-flattening safeguards from MUX methodology.

### ADR-041 Alignment

#749 fix demonstrated ADR-041 value:
- Migration was CORRECT (VARCHAR)
- Model violated ADR-041 by using `Enum(NodeType)`
- Fix: String in database, enum conversion in code

The ADR predicted this exact scenario.

## Tomorrow's Focus

1. **M0 Issue Creation** - Convert drafts to GitHub issues
2. **Pattern Sweep** - Due today (GitHub Action will create issue)
3. **Ship #028** - Ready for mid-week publication
4. **Continue Alpha Testing** - With fixed todo feature
