# Omnibus Session Log: February 4, 2026 (Wednesday)

## Day Overview

A light day by Piper Morgan standards. PM was busy outside the project, resulting in only three evening sessions. The Docs agent synthesized the Feb 3 omnibus from 5 source logs. The CIO reviewed the Pattern Sweep 2.0 deliverables and issued decisions on the three pending items: approved Pattern-060 (Cascade Investigation), deferred Pattern-061 (Design Archaeology) to proto-pattern tracking, and directed clarification rather than deprecation of Pattern-029 vs 059. The Chief of Staff did a brief status sync confirming the current position and tracking open items.

**Format**: Standard Day (3 sessions, single coordination thread)
**Day Rating**: LIGHT (documentation synthesis + CIO decisions + status sync)

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. CIO Pattern Sweep Decisions

The CIO reviewed all 5 pattern sweep deliverables and the Docs Agent's findings memo, then issued decisions on the three pending items:

| Decision | Outcome | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Pattern-060 (Cascade Investigation) | **APPROVED** | Strong multi-instance attestation; genuinely distinct from 041/042 |
| Pattern-061 (Design Archaeology) | **DEFERRED** | One instance insufficient; track as proto-pattern until March sweep |
| Pattern-029 vs 059 | **CLARIFY** | Serve different domains (technical vs. leadership); mutually differentiate, don't deprecate |

### 2. CIO Process Guidance

Beyond the three decisions, the CIO provided substantive guidance on process recommendations:

- **Pattern families**: Agreed to operationalize. Proposed 3-tier approach (established / emerging / unaffiliated). Suggested embedding family references in skills and gameplan templates rather than requiring memorization
- **Architecture health check**: Two-pronged method â€” code archaeology by Lead Dev + spot-check in Feb 17 methodology audit
- **Sprint Gate model**: Track informally through M0; don't formalize yet
- **Sweep scalability**: Flagged concern about sweep complexity growing with catalog size

### 3. Assignments Generated

| Item | Owner | Timeline |
|------|-------|----------|
| Draft Pattern-060 (Cascade Investigation) | Docs Agent | This week |
| Add Design Archaeology to proto-pattern tracking | Docs Agent | This week |
| Update 029/059 with mutual differentiation | Docs Agent | This week |
| Propose pattern family index format | Docs Agent | Next 2 weeks |
| Architecture family code archaeology | Lead Dev | Before Feb 17 |
| Add architecture spot-check to Feb 17 audit | CIO/PM | Feb 17 |

### 4. Feb 3 Omnibus Synthesized

Docs Agent synthesized a High-Complexity Day omnibus from 5 source logs covering Lead Dev bug fixing (8 closed), Pattern Sweep 2.0, Sprint Gate template, workstream review, and alpha tester profiles.

### 5. Status Sync (Chief of Staff)

Confirmed current position:
- **Completed recently**: Gate template, M0-GATE issues, Pattern Sweep, CIO briefing, Ted Nadeau and Cindy Chastain calls
- **Pending**: Logging continuity (HOSR), Ted/Cindy notes to HOSR, website discussion (CXO), Ship #028 publication, Lead Dev bugs #780/#781
- **Tomorrow's expected focus**: HOSR conversation, CXO website, resume bug fixing, Ship #028

## Patterns & Observations

### CIO as Pattern Governance
The CIO's response memo demonstrates the value of having a dedicated governance role for the pattern catalog. The decision to approve 060 while deferring 061 with clear criteria ("if it appears 2+ more times before March 17") prevents catalog inflation while keeping the door open for genuine emergence.

### Light Days Have Value
Despite being rated LIGHT, this day produced 5 concrete decisions, 6 tracked assignments, and substantive process guidance. The CIO's 55-minute session was high-leverage â€” reviewing accumulated work and issuing directional decisions that shape the next two weeks of documentation work.

### Continuity Infrastructure Working
PM noted to Chief of Staff that days off now feel "safer" with the continuity infrastructure in place (omnibus logs, mailboxes, session logs, rolling agendas). The lightweight evening check-in (8 minutes) was sufficient to maintain thread continuity.
