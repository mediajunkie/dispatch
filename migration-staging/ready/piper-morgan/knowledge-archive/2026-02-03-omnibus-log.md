# Omnibus Session Log: February 3, 2026 (Tuesday)

## Day Overview

A high-complexity day spanning five parallel work streams across documentation, engineering, coordination, architecture, and human relations. The morning focused on clearing a large git backlog (~140 uncommitted files organized into 6 commits) and creating the Feb 2 omnibus. The afternoon brought two major tracks: the Lead Developer ran an intensive alpha bug-fixing session that closed 8 issues (timezone migration, setup auth, Notion UX), while the Docs agent completed the full Pattern Sweep 2.0 (#777) with 4 parallel analysis agents. The Chief of Staff completed a 5-workstream review, the Chief Architect delivered the Sprint Gate template, and the HoSR began a structured alpha tester review creating 4 tester profiles.

**Format**: High-Complexity Day (~5 parallel work streams)
**Day Rating**: HIGH-VELOCITY (8 bugs closed + Pattern Sweep + Gate template + Tester review)

## Timeline

### Morning Block (11:23 AM - 12:25 PM)

- 11:23 **docs-code** creates Feb 2 omnibus log from 3 source logs (STANDARD day: timezone bugs + planning alignment)
- 11:48 **docs-code** audits git status â€” finds ~107 modified files, 35 untracked, 3 unpushed commits
- 11:50 **docs-code** organizes changes into 5 logical commits: timezone fix (8 files), timezone refactor (90 files), M0 Glue docs (8 files), doc structure (11 files), mailbox sync (19 memos)
- 12:02 **Lead Dev** starts session â€” PM has resumed end-to-end beta testing with new issues
- 12:02 **Lead Dev** receives 4 beta bug reports: account creation hangs, all tokens rejected, Slack 401, Notion prefix outdated
- 12:15 **Lead Dev** root cause analysis: #769 (missing `timezone` import in token_blacklist.py), #770 (naive vs aware datetime mismatch in setup), schema drift across 73 columns/27 tables
- 12:19 **docs-code** recommends `.beads/` be gitignored; PM approves; implemented and pushed
- 12:20 **Lead Dev** fixes #769 and #770 â€” PM confirms login working
- 12:23 **Lead Dev** discovers systemic pattern: 62 files use `timezone.utc` but DB has `timestamp without time zone`. Creates #771

### Afternoon Block (12:30 PM - 5:45 PM)

- 12:30 **Lead Dev** PM approves Option A: migrate DB to `timestamptz`. Audit-cascade on #771 begins
- 12:33 **Lead Dev** completes audit cascade: issue audit (29/29), gameplan (5 phases), gameplan audit (21/21)
- 12:37 **Lead Dev** creates Alembic migration `d73b3722eb03` â€” converts 73 columns to `timestamptz`. Zero `timestamp without time zone` columns remain
- 12:38 **Lead Dev** code cleanup: replaces `utc_now_naive` â†’ `utc_now` in 4 files. 28 tests passing
- 1:04 **Lead Dev** PM reports more bugs: Slack credentials 401, FTUX overlay broken, Notion placeholder/keychain/button issues
- 1:37 **Lead Dev** investigates: #772 Slack needs unauthenticated setup endpoint; FTUX may need product discussion
- 1:45 **Lead Dev** implements #772 fix: new `/setup/slack-credentials` endpoint
- 4:41 **Lead Dev** session resumes â€” Slack still failing (browser cache). Hard refresh fixes it. #772 verified and closed
- 4:45 **Chief of Staff** starts workstream review â€” orients from Feb 2 omnibus, resumes rolling agenda
- 4:50 **Lead Dev** discovers #773: schema drift validator false positive (DateTime vs timestamptz comparison)
- 4:52 **Chief Architect** starts session â€” reads Gate memo from Chief of Staff
- 4:55 **HoSR** starts session â€” resuming from Jan 31, beginning alpha tester review
- 5:02 **Lead Dev** audit-cascade on Notion UX bugs: #774 (one-line placeholder fix), #775 (already implemented!), #776 (validate button state)
- 5:10 **Lead Dev** identifies #776 root cause: button re-enables after validation. Fix: keep disabled on success
- 5:12 **Chief Architect** delivers `sprint-gate-template-v1.md` with 3 gates (Persistence, Anti-Flattening, Multi-Tenancy) and response memo
- 5:14 **Chief of Staff** reviews Gate template delivery, methodology items, pattern sweep status
- 5:18 **docs-code** investigates pattern sweep scheduling â€” finds cron/date mismatch (Monday cron, Tuesday dates). Fixes to Tuesdays. Manually triggers â†’ #777
- 5:25 **Chief of Staff** completes 5-workstream review (all aligned). Daily check-in cadence discussed and affirmed
- 5:28 **HoSR** begins one-by-one alpha tester review
- 5:32 **Lead Dev** PM verifies Notion fixes. #774, #775, #776 all closed
- 5:45 **docs-code** Pattern Sweep 2.0 complete: 60 patterns analyzed, 2 TRUE EMERGENCE candidates, coverage 15.5% â†’ 28.3%

### Evening Block (5:45 PM - 9:26 PM)

- 5:42 **HoSR** receives current alpha tester roster: 7 active, 7 interested-not-scheduled
- 6:00-9:00 **HoSR** creates/updates 4 tester profiles: Michelle Hertzfeld, Adam Laskowitz, Beatrice Mercier, Rebecca Refoy â€” with context from Nov-Jan call notes
- 9:19 **Lead Dev** PM tests FTUX overlay with fresh user â€” overlay dismisses but doesn't do anything useful. Disabled pending design reconsideration (#778)
- 9:19 **Lead Dev** discovers 2 more bugs from logs: #780 (history sidebar 404), #781 (Notion plugin crash on startup)
- 9:21 **docs-code** commits pattern sweep results + CIO memo, pushes to remote. #777 closed
- 9:25 **Lead Dev** PM confirms #775 working as designed (keychain shows after key stored)
- 9:26 **HoSR** pauses for the night â€” 3 active testers remaining (Jake, Ted, Dominique)

## Patterns & Observations

### Timezone Saga Conclusion
The systemic timezone issue first discovered Feb 1 (#757) reached its definitive resolution with the `timestamptz` migration. The cascade: import bug â†’ datetime mismatch â†’ schema drift audit â†’ 73-column migration â†’ code cleanup. This completes the pattern that started with file scoring and expanded to the entire database.

### Sprint Gate as Process Innovation
The Gate template represents the operationalization of lessons from the 75% Pattern (Pattern-045). Three specific failure modes (Aug 2025 stubs, #728 projects, #734 calendar) produced three corresponding gates. Evidence tables and sign-off separation prevent the "checkbox without work" anti-pattern.

### Alpha Testing Velocity
8 bugs filed and closed in a single day demonstrates the value of active PM beta testing. The cascade from account creation (blockers #769/#770) through setup UX (#772-#776) follows the Cascade Investigation pattern identified in the pattern sweep.

### HoSR Structured Review
First systematic pass through alpha tester profiles with context from historical call notes. Creating durable profiles enables continuity across sessions and provides relationship context for future interactions.
