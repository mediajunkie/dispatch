# Release Notes v0.8.6

**Release Date**: March 4, 2026
**Branch**: `main`
**Previous Version**: v0.8.5.3
**Sprint**: M0 — Conversational Glue

---

## Summary

This release delivers the M0 Conversational Glue sprint, transforming Piper from "chatbot with features" into a conversational colleague. Users can now converse naturally with Piper — workflows emerge from conversation; commands are shortcuts, not requirements. The release also includes repository management, conversation lifecycle tracking, security hardening, and 8 bug fixes from post-gate CXO testing.

**Reference**: PDR-002 v3.1 (Conversational Glue)

## What's New

### Conversational Glue (M0 Sprint)

Five core features that make Piper conversational:

- **#766 - Narrative System**: Piper adapts tone to relationship stage (first meeting → warm introduction, returning user → concise colleague). Eliminates the repeated "Is that your main project?" question during onboarding.

- **#763 - Conversational Lens Tracking**: Piper remembers what you're talking about. Follow-up queries like "what about next week?" resolve correctly based on conversational context (>90% follow-up resolution). 152 new tests.

- **#765 - Natural Slot Filling**: When Piper needs information to complete a task, it asks naturally instead of interrogating. Lens-aware prompt phrasing adapts to conversational context. 124 new tests.

- **#764 - Multi-Intent Orchestration**: Handle compound queries like "check my calendar and create an issue for the API bug" coherently, with natural topic transitions ("As for your calendar..."). 47 new tests.

- **#767 - Soft Workflow Invocation**: Piper offers workflows conversationally ("Sounds like you might want to set up a meeting...") instead of requiring explicit commands. Graceful decline handling. 79 new tests.

### Repository Management

- **#866 - Repository Entity**: Repository as a first-class domain entity with many-to-many Project links.
- **#861 - Settings UI**: Project integration and repository management page.
- **#860 - Setup Wizard**: Project-repo linking step in onboarding.
- **#863 - Portfolio Onboarding**: Repo-linking step during portfolio setup.
- **#862 - Conversational Repo Management**: Natural language handler for repo operations.
- **#867 - GitHub Validation**: API validation for repository link operations.

### Conversation Lifecycle

- **#715/#858 - Conversation State Machine**: Conversations now track lifecycle state (active, stale, archived) with proper database columns and repository support.

### Supporting Infrastructure

- **#852 - Contextual Offer Continuation**: Bare-affirmative responses ("yes", "sure") correctly continue soft-offer workflows.
- **#838 - Unified Formality Framework**: Consistent formality calibration across all interaction channels.
- **#853 - SessionStart Hook**: Automated session start checks for agent session logs, mailbox, and briefing freshness.
- **#849 - User-Scoped Keychain Isolation**: Security fix ensuring integration credentials are properly scoped per user.
