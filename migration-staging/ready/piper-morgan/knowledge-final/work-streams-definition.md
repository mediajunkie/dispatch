# Piper Morgan Work Streams - Official Definition

**Status**: Active as of November 7, 2025  
**Version**: 2.0 (Formalized)  
**Owner**: Chief of Staff

---

## Purpose

Work streams provide a systematic framework for reviewing project status across multiple dimensions. They enable:
- Comprehensive weekly status reviews
- Early identification of blockers and risks
- Balanced attention across operational and strategic concerns
- Historical tracking of project evolution

**Current Focus**: Haiku 4.5 deployment status, monthly LLM spend tracking  
**Status Indicators**: Monthly costs, cost per feature, model distribution, infrastructure efficiency  
**Phase Sensitivity**: MEDIUM - becomes more critical at scale, periodic deep reviews

---

### 5. Documentation
**Purpose**: Maintain internal documentation quality and completeness  
**Scope**:
- Technical documentation
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Developer onboarding materials
- API documentation
- Configuration guides
- Troubleshooting resources
- Session log archives

**Current Focus**: Alpha onboarding docs need updating for authentication flow  
**Status Indicators**: Doc coverage completeness, freshness (last updated), user feedback on clarity  
**Phase Sensitivity**: MEDIUM - spikes during major changes, steady-state maintenance otherwise

---

### 6. Communications
**Purpose**: Manage public-facing content and community engagement  
**Scope**:
- Weekly Ship publication (Thursdays/Fridays)
- Daily blog posts (Building in Public series)
- LinkedIn content and engagement
- Newsletter management
- Community feedback and questions
- Speaking opportunities and partnerships

**Current Focus**: Weekly Ship #016 due, maintaining blog cadence  
**Status Indicators**: Weekly Ship consistency, blog post frequency, engagement metrics, subscriber growth  
**Phase Sensitivity**: HIGH - critical for "building in public" strategy, requires consistent weekly effort

---

### 7. Strategic Planning
**Purpose**: Capture and evaluate future initiatives and opportunities  
**Scope**:
- New feature ideas and requests
- Partnership opportunities
- Market validation insights
- User research findings
- Competitive analysis
- Long-term roadmap considerations
- Pivot or expansion opportunities

**Current Focus**: Ideas collected since Nov 3 review  
**Status Indicators**: Ideas captured, evaluation status, graduation to active work  
**Phase Sensitivity**: MEDIUM - continuous collection, periodic (monthly/quarterly) strategic review

---

## Historical Evolution

### Version 1.0: Foundation Phase (July 2025)
During the foundation building phase, work streams were **project-structure focused**:

1. Core Build progress
2. Architecture evolution  
3. Debugging patterns
4. Documentation status
5. Learning Curation pipeline
6. Kind Systems updates
7. Public Content metrics

**Context**: Building from scratch, focus on what parts of system exist and their maturity.

**Limitations**: As project matured, these categories became less useful for operational status tracking. "Core Build" is too vague when everything is "core." "Architecture evolution" happens continuously. "Debugging patterns" is methodology, not a work stream.

### Version 1.5: Alpha Transition (November 2025)
During transition to alpha testing, streams evolved to **operational-status focused**:

1. Alpha Testing Stream
2. Technical Debt Stream
3. Pattern Sweep  
4. Cost Optimization Stream
5. Documentation/Communication Stream (bundled)
6. New Ideas Backlog

**Context**: Shift to user testing phase, need for operational visibility over component tracking.

**Improvements**: Better aligned with operational needs, clearer action items per stream.

**Limitations**: Some bundling (docs + comms), names could be more phase-agnostic, missing explicit methodology focus.

### Version 2.0: Formalized Framework (November 7, 2025)
Current formalized structure addresses previous limitations:

**Key Changes**:
- Split Documentation/Communications into separate streams (different audiences, cadences)
- Renamed for phase-agnosticism: "Alpha Testing" â†’ "User Testing"
- Elevated methodology to its own stream (Methodology Evolution)
- Clarified System Health scope beyond just debt
- Added phase sensitivity indicators
- Defined clear scope and status indicators for each stream
- Removed external work tracking (Kind Systems, VA work)

## Usage Guidelines

### Weekly Review Process
**Timing**: Thursday afternoons before Weekly Ship preparation  
**Participants**: PM, Chief of Staff, (optional: Chief Architect, Lead Developer)

**Review Each Stream**:
1. Current status (what's happening)
2. Recent changes (what changed this week)
3. Blockers or risks (what's stuck)
4. Decisions needed (what requires PM input)
5. Next actions (what happens next)

### Work Stream Selection for Weekly Ship
Not all streams appear in every Weekly Ship. Select 2-3 streams with:
- Significant progress or changes
- Critical blockers or decisions
- Community-relevant insights
- Strategic importance for building-in-public narrative

### Evolution Trigger Points
Review work stream definitions when:
- Major project phase change (alpha â†’ beta â†’ production)
- Consistent friction with current categories (>3 weeks)
- New permanent concerns emerge
- Quarterly strategic reviews

---

## Non-Goals

**What We Don't Track Here**:
- External work (Kind Systems 25%, VA work 70%)
- Personal health/wellness tracking
- Client work unrelated to Piper Morgan
- Individual task-level tracking (use GitHub issues for that)

---

## Success Metrics

The work stream framework succeeds when:
- Weekly reviews complete in <60 minutes
- No critical issues surface unexpectedly
- PM has clear visibility across all dimensions
- Weekly Ships draw from comprehensive status picture
- Strategic opportunities don't get lost
- Blockers identified early enough to resolve proactively
