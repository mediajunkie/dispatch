**Release Date**: January 8, 2026
**Release Type**: Feature Release (Epic #242 Complete)

---

## Overview

This release completes Epic #242: CONV-MCP-STANDUP-INTERACTIVE, delivering a fully conversational standup creation experience. Users can now create standups through natural dialogue with Piper, with preference learning, iterative refinement, and comprehensive performance monitoring.

---

## What's New

### Interactive Standup Assistant (Epic #242)

**Conversational standup creation via chat**

Start a standup conversation with "let's write a standup" or "/standup" and Piper will guide you through the process interactively:

- **Preference gathering**: Tell Piper your style preferences (concise, detailed, bullet points)
- **Iterative refinement**: Request changes until you're happy with the result
- **Version history**: Previous versions saved if you want to compare
- **Performance**: Sub-500ms response times with P95 at 0.03ms

### 7-State Conversation Flow

The standup conversation uses a state machine with 7 distinct states:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| INITIATED | Conversation started, awaiting first user input |
| GATHERING_PREFERENCES | Collecting user preferences for standup style |
| GENERATING | Creating standup content from context |
| REFINING | User requesting changes to generated standup |
| FINALIZING | User approving final version |
| COMPLETE | Standup completed successfully |
| ABANDONED | User abandoned the conversation |

### Performance Monitoring (Issue #556)

Comprehensive structured logging for all standup operations:

- Turn response times with state transition tracking
- Generation success/failure metrics
- Retry and fallback tracking
- Conversation lifecycle events (completion, abandonment)

## Technical Details

### Files Created

- `services/standup/conversation_handler.py` - Turn handling with retry logic
- `services/standup/conversation_manager.py` - State machine management
- `tests/performance/test_standup_performance.py` - Performance test suite

### Files Modified

- `services/features/morning_standup.py` - Parallel fetch optimization
- `services/domain/models.py` - StandupConversation, ConversationTurn models
- `services/shared_types.py` - StandupConversationState enum

### Test Coverage

- **260 new standup tests** covering:
  - Conversation state management (65 tests)
  - Turn handling and response (82 tests)
  - Preference learning (36 tests)
  - LLM workflow integration (67 tests)
  - Performance and load testing (10 tests)

### Reliability Features

- **Retry logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures (3 retries, 0.5-2s wait)
- **Timeout handling**: 10-second timeout for generation
- **Error categorization**: TransientError vs PermanentError for smart retry decisions
- **Graceful fallback**: Basic template when all else fails
- **Memory optimization**: Turn history capped at 50 to prevent unbounded growth

## Known Issues

See [ALPHA_KNOWN_ISSUES.md](../ALPHA_KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for current known issues.
