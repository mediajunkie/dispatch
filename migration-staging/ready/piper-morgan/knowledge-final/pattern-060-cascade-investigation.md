# Pattern-060: Cascade Investigation

## Status

**Emerging** | Proven in #745, #771

## Context

Bug fixing typically follows a reactive cycle: find bug, fix bug, move on. This leaves adjacent issues undiscovered until they surface independently â€” often at worse times. Development teams experience:
- Related bugs appearing in clusters over days or weeks
- The same root cause manifesting in multiple places
- Category-wide issues hiding behind individual symptoms
- Missed opportunities to fix an entire class of problems at once

The Cascade Investigation pattern addresses this by treating every bug fix as a trigger for category-wide audit, turning a single fix into a systematic sweep that surfaces adjacent problems while context is fresh.

## Pattern Description

**Core Concept**: When fixing a bug, audit the entire category before moving to the next task.

1. **Trigger**: Any bug fix or investigation reveals an issue
2. **Category Audit**: Ask "what else in this category might be broken?"
3. **Adjacent Discovery**: Each finding triggers its own category audit
4. **Cascade Tracking**: Document the cascade chain (depth and breadth)
5. **Systematic Resolution**: Fix or file every discovery â€” nothing is ignored

The key insight: a single bug is rarely alone. The conditions that created it likely created siblings. Fixing one without auditing the category is leaving known unknowns on the table.

**What distinguishes this from related patterns**:
- Pattern-041 (Systematic Fix Planning) is about *planning* how to fix multiple known issues
- Pattern-042 (Investigation-Only Protocol) is about *restraint* â€” investigating without fixing
- Pattern-060 is about the *cascade itself*: each finding triggering a category-wide audit that surfaces adjacent problems

Resolution + Evidence Table

### Cascade Evidence Table

Each cascade investigation should produce an evidence table documenting depth:

```markdown
| Depth | Discovery | Category Audited | Issues Found | Action |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| 0 | Original bug | â€” | 1 | Fixed |
| 1 | Category audit | [category] | N | Fixed/Filed |
| 2 | Adjacent category | [category] | N | Fixed/Filed |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| **Total** | | | **X issues** | |
```

### Process

```
1. Fix the original bug
2. PAUSE â€” don't move to next task
3. Ask: "What category does this bug belong to?"
   - Examples: timezone handling, user scoping, auth flow, setup UX
4. Audit: Search codebase for same pattern in that category
   - grep for similar code patterns
   - Check related files/modules
   - Review tests for same assumptions
5. For each discovery:
   a. Fix if quick (<5 min) or file as tracked issue
   b. Ask: "Does this suggest a DIFFERENT category to audit?"
   c. If yes, repeat from step 3 for the new category
6. Document cascade in evidence table
7. Report total discoveries to PM
```

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use

- After fixing any bug (the trigger is universal)
- When a bug involves a systemic pattern (e.g., wrong import, missing parameter, outdated API)
- When the root cause could plausibly exist in other files or modules
- During dedicated bug-fixing sessions where context-switching cost is low

### When NOT to Use

- Truly isolated bugs with no categorical siblings (rare but possible)
- Time-boxed sessions where the PM has prioritized specific issues
- When the cascade would cross into unfamiliar domains (hand off instead)

### Best Practices

1. **Always ask the category question** â€” Even if the answer is "no siblings," asking is the discipline
2. **File, don't defer** â€” Every discovery gets a tracking issue immediately (Pattern-046)
3. **Document cascade depth** â€” The evidence table proves investigation thoroughness
4. **Know when to stop** â€” Cascades beyond depth 3 may indicate an architectural issue, not a bug pattern. Escalate rather than continuing
5. **Time-box each depth level** â€” Audit the category, don't audit the codebase
