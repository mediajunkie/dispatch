# PPM Weekly Product Summary â€” Feb 6-12, 2026

**From**: Principal Product Manager  
**Date**: February 13, 2026  
**Week**: Feb 6-12  
**Context**: PM recovering from flu (days 1-7+), reduced velocity

## Product Perspective

Despite PM illness, this was a quietly productive week for product. The infrastructure held â€” agents continued productive work with minimal oversight. More importantly, **we resolved a significant flattening issue** (History Sidebar) and **validated our alpha testing program** (Ted Nadeau's 14 Windows issues all resolved in single session, new tester onboarding).

### Key Product Accomplishments

#### 1. History Sidebar Differentiation â€” Flattening Resolved

The week opened with resolution of the History Sidebar flattening issue:
- **Problem identified** (Feb 6): Both sidebars showing same data
- **Decision made**: Visible-but-differentiated (not hide)
- **Cathedral document created**: PDR-002 Appendix Layer 2 Vision
- **Implementation approved**: GLUE-HISTORY-DIFF (#786), 3-4 hours
- **Completed same day** (Feb 6): Search wired, monthly grouping

This is a methodology success story â€” flattening caught before shipping confusing UX to alpha testers.

#### 2. Website Strategy â†’ Implementation (Feb 8-9)

Complete cycle from open questions to deployed code in 48 hours:
- **Strategy** (CXO): Audience segmentation, site-product relationship, CTA hierarchy
- **Copy** (Comms): Full 7-page draft with approved hero
- **Implementation** (Web Dev): 5 phases, 4 new pages, navigation redesign
- **Review** (PM): Screenshots captured for feedback

Core positioning articulated: "PM tools assume work is items in lists. But PM work is actually relationships between concerns at different scales."

#### 3. Alpha Testing Program Validated

**Ted Nadeau's Windows feedback**:
- 14 issues extracted from bug report
- All 14 resolved in single Lead Dev session (Feb 11)
- v0.8.5.3 released same day
- Process: BLOCKER â†’ HIGH â†’ MEDIUM â†’ LOW prioritization worked

**New tester onboarding** (Feb 12):
- Dominique Derosena (Justin Maxwell's colleague) began setup
- Immediately hit batch file bug â†’ exposed untested code path
- Led to Windows CI infrastructure creation

**Validation**: Alpha testers find real issues. Process can handle them efficiently.

#### 4. Two Releases Shipped

| Version | Date | Key Fixes |
|---------|------|-----------|
| v0.8.5.2 | Feb 6 | 4 alpha bugs including cross-user session bleed (P0 security) |
| v0.8.5.3 | Feb 11 | 14 Windows compatibility issues, missing migrations |

## M0 Status

**M0 has not started implementation.**

This is expected â€” PM illness coincided with sprint start window. The planning work from Feb 1 (PDR-002 v3.1, 6 GLUE issues, stakeholder alignment) remains valid and ready.

**M0 Issues ready**:
| Issue | Title | Effort |
|-------|-------|--------|
| #762 | EPIC: GLUE | â€” |
| #763 | GLUE-FOLLOWUP | 3-5d |
| #764 | GLUE-MULTIINTENT | 3-5d |
| #765 | GLUE-SLOTFILL | 3-5d |
| #766 | GLUE-MAINPROJ | 1-2d |
| #767 | GLUE-SOFTINVOKE | 3-5d |
| #786 | GLUE-HISTORY-DIFF | âœ… COMPLETE |

**Net M0 status**: One issue complete (#786), five ready to start. Foundation work (security, Windows compatibility) now more solid.

## Inchworm Position

**Still at 4.4.0** â€” MUX Complete, MVP Sprints ready to begin.

The week was productive but didn't advance the inchworm. That's appropriate given PM capacity. The work done (releases, alpha fixes, website) strengthens the foundation without changing position.

---

## Concerns / Flags

### 1. M0 Start Date Slipping

Original M0 target was "February." We're now mid-February with no implementation started. This isn't a crisis â€” the planning is done and the sprint can start when PM is healthy â€” but worth acknowledging.

**Recommendation**: Begin M0 implementation when PM recovers, starting with smallest issue (#766 GLUE-MAINPROJ, 1-2d) to rebuild momentum.

### 2. Narrative Confabulation Pattern

Comms discovered systematic fabrication in draft blog posts â€” invented numbers, wrong timelines, false causality. New skill created, but this is a quality concern for Building in Public content.

**Risk**: Published content may contain similar fabrications from before the skill was created.

### 3. Windows Testing Gap

Despite v0.8.5.3 and Windows CI, we've had three separate Windows issues surface (Ted's 14, Dominique's batch bug, pre-existing December bug). Cross-platform parity remains fragile.

## Looking Ahead (Feb 13-19)

1. **PM recovery** â†’ resume normal capacity
2. **M0 kickoff** â†’ start with GLUE-MAINPROJ or GLUE-SLOTFILL
3. **Ship #030** â†’ publish weekly newsletter
4. **Dominique follow-up** â†’ verify Windows setup working
5. **Michelle re-engagement** â†’ she wants to try latest builds

*Week rating: INFRASTRUCTURE-RESILIENCE â€” The continuity systems worked. Agents produced meaningful output despite PM at reduced capacity. That's the cathedral at work.*
