# Knowledge Dependency Graphs: Session Analysis (Aug 16 - Sep 3, 2025)

## Graph Construction Methodology

**Dependency Definition**: Concept A depends on Concept B if understanding B is prerequisite to meaningful application of A.

**Edge Types**:
- `â†’` Direct dependency (strong prerequisite)  
- `â‡’` Indirect dependency (helpful but not essential)
- `â†”` Mutual dependency (concepts reinforce each other)
- `âŸ²` Circular dependency (concepts evolve together)
