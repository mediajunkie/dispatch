# Alpha Feature Guide (v0.8.6)

**Version**: 0.8.6
**Last Updated**: March 4, 2026

A guide to what Piper Morgan can do in the current alpha release.

---

## Quick Start

| Task | How |
|------|-----|
| Start Piper | `python main.py` → opens http://localhost:8001 |
| Check system health | `python main.py status` |
| Run setup wizard | `python main.py setup` or visit /setup in browser |
| Set preferences | `python main.py preferences` |

---

## Getting Set Up

### GUI Setup Wizard

The easiest way to get started. Visit http://localhost:8001/setup after starting Piper.

**What it does:**
- Checks system health (Docker, Python, ports, database)
- Configures API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Notion)
- Creates your user account
- Connects integrations via OAuth (Slack, Google Calendar)

### CLI Alternative

For terminal lovers: `python main.py setup` walks through the same process.

### System Health Check

Run `python main.py status` anytime to verify:
- Database connection
- API key validity
- Integration health
- Performance metrics

## Core Features

### Chat with Piper

The main interface. Type naturally and Piper responds.

**What Piper understands well:**

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Identity | "What's your name?" "What can you do?" "Are you working?" |
| Time | "What day is it?" "What did we do yesterday?" "What's on my agenda?" |
| Projects | "What projects am I working on?" "Status of [project]?" "Which should I focus on?" |
| Actions | "Create a GitHub issue about X" "Give me a status report" |

**For full chat capabilities**, see the [Canonical Query Test Matrix](internal/testing/canonical-query-test-matrix.md) — 19 of 25 query types work (76%).

### Interactive Standup

Create standup reports through conversation.

**How to use:**
1. Say "let's write a standup" or type `/standup`
2. Piper asks what you accomplished, what's next, any blockers
3. Review and refine iteratively until satisfied
4. Piper learns your preferences over time

### Portfolio Onboarding

For new users, Piper guides you through setting up your projects.

**How it works:**
1. Say "Hello!" as a new user
2. Piper offers to help set up your portfolio
3. Describe your projects conversationally
4. Projects are saved for future context

## Managing Your Work

### Lists, Todos, Projects

All three work similarly with full CRUD and sharing:

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| View | Click "Your Stuff" → Lists/Todos/Projects |
| Create | Click "+ Create" button |
| Edit | Click item → Edit |
| Delete | Click item → Delete (if you're owner/admin) |
| Share | Click item → Share → Enter email + role |

**Sharing roles:**
- **Viewer**: Can see but not modify
- **Editor**: Can modify but not delete or share
- **Admin**: Full access except transfer ownership

### Files

Upload and manage documents.

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Upload | Files page → Upload (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, JSON up to 10MB) |
| Download | Click file → Download |
| Delete | Click file → Delete |

Files are user-isolated — you only see your own.

### Lifecycle Indicators

Projects and todos show lifecycle status badges:
- **Active**: Currently being worked on
- **Paused**: On hold
- **Completed**: Done
- **Archived**: No longer relevant

## Integrations

### Integration Health Dashboard

**Where**: Settings → Integrations

Check the health of all your connected services:
- Green = Healthy

## Personalization

### Preferences

Run `python main.py preferences` to set your preferences across 5 dimensions:

| Dimension | What it affects |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Communication | How Piper phrases responses |
| Work style | Task recommendations |
| Decision making | How much guidance vs. options |
| Learning | Explanation depth |
| Feedback | How Piper gives suggestions |

### Learning System

Piper learns from your interactions over time:
- Communication patterns
- Preferred workflows
- Common requests

This is experimental — feedback welcome on whether personalization feels accurate.

---

## Accessibility

Piper is designed to be accessible:

- **Keyboard navigation**: Tab through all UI elements
- **Screen readers**: ARIA landmarks throughout
- **High contrast**: Respects system preference
- **Reduced motion**: Respects system preference
- **Color contrast**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant (4.5:1 minimum)

## Security

### What's Protected

| Data | Protection |
|------|------------|

### What's Not Yet Protected

### Audit Logging

All sensitive operations are logged:
- Authentication events
- API key operations
- User actions
