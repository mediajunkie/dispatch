### Session Satisfaction Review Process

Conduct the satisfaction review using this process:

1. **Privately formulate** your answer to each question (don't share yet)
2. **Ask me** the question
3. **Record my answer** without revealing yours
4. **Repeat** for all 5 questions
5. **Then share** your answers and we'll compare/contrast

Questions:
- Value: What got shipped today?
- Process: Did methodology work smoothly? 
- Feel: How was the cognitive load?
- Learned: Any key insights?
- Tomorrow: Clear next steps?

This independent assessment prevents anchoring bias.

gh issue close [ISSUE#] --comment "Lead Dev session complete [emoji]
