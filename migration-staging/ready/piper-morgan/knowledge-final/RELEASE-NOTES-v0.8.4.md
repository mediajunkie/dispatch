# Release Notes: v0.8.4

**Release Date**: January 12, 2026
**Release Type**: Feature Release (Sprint B1 Complete, 2 Epics)

---

## Overview

This release completes Sprint B1, delivering two major capabilities: **Integration Settings** (Epic #543) and **Portfolio Onboarding** (Issue #490). Users can now manage all their integration credentials from a unified Settings page, and new users experience a conversational onboarding flow that helps them set up their project portfolio.

**Key improvements in this release:**
- **Integration credential management**: Configure Slack, Calendar, GitHub, and Notion credentials directly in Settings with OAuth flows and secure storage
- **Portfolio onboarding**: Tell Piper about your projects during first meeting, making subsequent conversations more contextual
- **Bug fixes**: Logout 403 errors resolved, OAuth test buttons now use correct tokens, Demo integration disabled by default

**Try it now:** Visit Settings â†’ Integrations to configure your tools, or start a fresh session and greet Piper to experience the portfolio onboarding flow.

## What's New

### Epic #543: Integration Settings

**Unified credential management for all integrations**

All integration credentials can now be configured from Settings â†’ Integrations:

| Integration | Configuration Method | Features |
|-------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Slack** | OAuth Connect button | Connect/disconnect, token stored securely |
| **Google Calendar** | OAuth Connect button | Sync preferences, auto-refresh tokens |
| **GitHub** | Personal Access Token | Keychain fallback, repository preferences |
| **Notion** | API Key | Keychain fallback, workspace preferences |

**Issues completed:**
- #576: Slack OAuth credential UI
- #577: Google Calendar OAuth credential UI

### Issue #490: Portfolio Onboarding (FTUX-PORTFOLIO)

**Conversational project setup for new users**

When Piper meets a new user (detected via first greeting), it initiates a portfolio onboarding conversation:

```
User: Hello!
Piper: Hello! I'm Piper Morgan, your PM assistant. I notice we haven't
       set up your project portfolio yet. Would you like to tell me about
       the projects you're working on?

User: Sure, I'm working on Piper Morgan and Decision Reviews.
Piper: Got it! I'll remember that you're working on:
       â€¢ Piper Morgan
       â€¢ Decision Reviews
       Would you like to add more projects, or shall we continue?
```

**Features:**
- Multi-turn conversation with state machine (INITIATED â†’ GATHERING_PROJECTS â†’ CONFIRMING â†’ COMPLETE)
- Extracts project names from natural language
- Creates Project entities in database
- Integrates with existing onboarding detection

### Issue #365: Slack Attention Decay

**Pattern learning for attention models**

Slack message importance now decays over time with configurable patterns. This helps Piper prioritize recent messages over older ones when summarizing activity.

## Bug Fixes

| Issue | Fix | Impact |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Logout 403 | Fixed "Not authenticated" error on logout | Users can now log out without errors |

| Demo integration | Disabled by default | No longer confuses users with fake "Demo" integration |
