# Piper Morgan Glossary

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: November 30, 2025  
**Purpose**: Define project terminology, jargon, and concepts

## Core Concepts

### ADR (Architecture Decision Record)
A document capturing an important architectural decision including context, decision, and consequences. Numbered sequentially (ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.). Lives in `/docs/internal/architecture/current/adrs/`.

### Agent
An AI instance with specific role, capabilities, and context. Examples: Chief Architect (strategic), Lead Developer (tactical), Code Agent (implementation).

### Composting
The 8th lifecycle stage where deprecated objects decompose into learnings that feed new emergent objects. Part of the learning cycle. Metaphor: "filing dreams."

---

## Object Model Terms

### Entity
An actor with identity and agency. Can be human (User), AI (Piper, Agent), or organizational (Team, Project). From grammar: "**Entities** experience Moments in Places."

### Moment
A bounded significant occurrence with theatrical unity - has beginning, middle, end. Not just an event but a scene. From grammar: "Entities experience **Moments** in Places."

### Place
Context where action happens. Can be physical (office), digital (Slack channel), or conceptual (sprint planning). From grammar: "Entities experience Moments in **Places**."

### Situation
Container holding sequences of Moments. The frame, not a fourth substrate. Has narrative structure with dramatic tension.

---

## Ownership Model

### Native
Objects Piper creates, owns, and maintains. "Piper's Mind." Examples: Sessions, memories, concerns.

### Federated  
Objects Piper observes from external systems. "Piper's Senses." Examples: GitHub issues, Slack messages.

### Synthetic
Objects Piper constructs through reasoning. "Piper's Understanding." Examples: Inferred risks, assembled projects.

---

## Lifecycle Stages

The 8-stage lifecycle all objects follow:
1. **Emergent** - Just appearing
2. **Derived** - Understood from context  
3. **Noticed** - Piper becomes aware
4. **Proposed** - Suggested action/interpretation
5. **Ratified** - Confirmed/accepted
6. **Deprecated** - No longer active
7. **Archived** - Stored for reference
8. **Composted** - Decomposed into learnings

---

## Development Methodology

### Inchworm Protocol
Complete each phase 100% before proceeding to next. Linear progress with mandatory evidence collection. Prevents "75% pattern" where features are abandoned incomplete.

### 75% Pattern
The tendency for sophisticated implementations to be abandoned at ~75% completion, creating hidden technical debt. 

### Verification Theater
When tests pass but functionality remains broken. Tests that check form but not function.

### Excellence Flywheel
Four-pillar methodology: systematic verification, test-driven development, multi-agent coordination, GitHub-first tracking.

---

## Metaphors & Idioms

### Filing Dreams
Metaphor for composting process. Piper processes experiences during "rest" periods, not constant surveillance. "Having had some time to reflect..."

### Time Lord
PM role as keeper of bespoke time units, eliminating deadline pressure to maintain quality focus.

### Sinews
PM's role as connective tissue making multiple AI agents coherent and effective.

### Cathedral Building
Preference for lasting architecture over quick fixes. Quality and systematic completion over speed.

---

## Coordination Patterns

### Coordination Queue
Async work distribution system. Prompts in `/coordination/available/`, agents claim work, complete autonomously.

### Advisor Mailbox
File-based async communication pattern for external advisors. Inbox/outbox folders with manifest tracking.

### Convergence Points
Scheduled synchronization between parallel tracks (e.g., MUX-VISION defines, MUX-TECH implements).

---

## Technical Terms

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
Protocol for federated tool access. Strategic architectural advantage as early adopter.

### MUX (Modeled User Experience)  
UX track focused on consciousness model. Three layers: Vision (conceptual), Interact (design), Implement (polish).

### Morning Standup
The ONLY feature where original embodied consciousness vision survived. Our "North Star" reference implementation.

---

## Trust Gradient

Four-stage progression of user trust in Piper:
1. **Stage 1**: Minimal visibility, pull-only
2. **Stage 2**: Pull + on-request summaries  
3. **Stage 3**: Pull + periodic summaries
4. **Stage 4**: Proactive surfacing, push insights

---

## Anti-Patterns

### Flattening
When consciousness features degrade to mechanical functions. Example: Moments become tasks, consciousness becomes logging.

### Surveillance Framing
Language implying constant monitoring. Avoid "while you were away," prefer "having had time to reflect."

### Completion Bias
When agents claim success without evidence. Addressed by mandatory verification.

---

## Project-Specific

### Piper Morgan
AI-powered product management assistant with spatial intelligence and conversational interfaces.

### Play Acting
Benchmarking system comparing Piper to well-contexted Claude baselines.

### Beads
Informal task tracking for small items not warranting GitHub issues.
