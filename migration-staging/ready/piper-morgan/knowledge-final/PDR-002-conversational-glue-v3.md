# PDR-002: Conversational Glue

**Status**: Draft v3.1  
**Date**: February 1, 2026  
**Author**: Principal Product Manager  
**Stakeholders**: PM (xian), CXO, Chief Architect
**Review Status**: âœ… CXO Approved | âœ… Architect Approved

## Decision

Conversational continuity is a **first-class product feature**, not an infrastructure detail. The connective tissue between Piper's capabilitiesâ€”how conversations flow, how context persists, how discovery happensâ€”is as important as the capabilities themselves.

Piper's value proposition depends on this glue working seamlessly. A feature that exists but cannot be discovered, or that breaks conversational flow to be invoked, fails the colleague test.

**Core Vision** (v3): Users should be able to start a chat with Piper and converse naturally. Piper should carry on a general conversationâ€”especially one relevant to product managementâ€”and workflows should emerge naturally from that conversation. Commands and skill invocations are shortcuts, not requirements.

---

## Context

The CXO UX Strategy work (Nov 2025 - Jan 2026) revealed a critical insight: Piper's features are largely built, but users struggle to discover and use them naturally. The gap isn't capabilityâ€”it's continuity.

This manifests as:
- Users don't know what Piper can do until they ask the right question
- Transitions between tasks feel abrupt rather than conversational
- Context from previous interactions doesn't inform current ones
- Proactive suggestions feel random rather than situationally appropriate

Traditional product thinking treats these as UX polishâ€”nice to have after core features work. This PDR establishes the opposite: **conversational glue is core functionality**.

**February 2026 Update**: External research validates this positioning. Modern conversational AI best practices emphasize "conversation as collaboration, not interface" â€” the paradigm shift from command-driven to LLM-native dialogue patterns. See `conversational-glue-implementation-guide.md` for comprehensive research findings and implementation guidance.

## The Problem

### Capability Without Discovery is Invisible Capability

Piper can perform standup synthesis, issue triage, calendar analysis, document intelligence, and more. But if a user doesn't know to ask, these capabilities might as well not exist.

The blank prompt pattern ("What can I help you with?") places full articulation burden on users. Research shows ~50% of users struggle to articulate what they need from AI systems (Nielsen, 2024). These users will never discover Piper's valueâ€”not because Piper can't help, but because they can't ask.

### Context Loss Breaks the Colleague Metaphor

A colleague remembers what you discussed yesterday. A colleague notices patterns in your work. A colleague offers relevant help without being asked.

If Piper forgets context between sessions, treats each conversation as isolated, and only helps when explicitly requestedâ€”Piper isn't a colleague. Piper is a tool with a chat interface.

### Proactive Help Without Trust is Annoyance

Unsolicited suggestions can be helpful or annoying depending on:
- Whether the suggestion is relevant
- Whether the timing is appropriate
- Whether the user trusts the suggester's judgment

Piper must earn the right to be proactive. This requires a trust model that governs when and how suggestions surface.

### Scripted Interactions Break the Illusion (v3)

Research confirms that users are "conditioned to expect human-like interaction" from conversational systems. When assistants violate conversational normsâ€”parrot confirmations, interrogation-style slot filling, rigid scripted sequencesâ€”users notice immediately and "the illusion is broken by a faulty script."

Specific anti-patterns identified in current Piper implementation:
- "Is that your main project?" asked repeatedly during setup (they can't all be "main")
- Explicit confirmation dialogs for low-stakes actions
- Sequential slot-filling that ignores information already provided

---

## Decision Rationale

### Conversational Glue Has Three Components

**1. Discovery Glue**: How users learn what Piper can do
**2. Context Glue**: How information persists and connects across interactions
**3. Proactivity Glue**: How Piper offers help without being asked

Each component requires explicit product design, not just technical implementation.

### Five Foundational Principles (v3)

Based on research synthesis, all conversational design should follow these principles:

| Principle | What It Means | What It Forbids |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Conversation as Collaboration** | Piper is a colleague, not a command line | "I don't understand" without alternatives |
| **Implicit Over Explicit** | Default to implicit confirmation | Parrot confirmations, multi-step dialogs |
| **Information Flows Forward** | Never ask for already-provided info | Re-asking for project name mid-workflow |
| **Graceful Over Rigid** | Handle the unexpected gracefully | "Complete current workflow first" |
| **Trust Governs Autonomy** | Proactivity increases with demonstrated competence | Maximum proactivity from day one |

---

## Component 1: Discovery Glue

### The Recognition Interface Pattern

Piper articulates the situation first, then offers relevant actions. This inverts the typical AI pattern where users must know what to ask.

**Instead of**: Blank prompt waiting for user input

**Do this**: Piper observes context and offers:
> "You have 3 GitHub issues that changed overnight and a standup in 2 hours. Want me to summarize the issues, or help you prep for standup?"

### Contextual Capability Hints

After successful task completion, Piper may surface one related capability the user hasn't used.

**Throttling rules** (prevent annoyance):
- Maximum 2 suggestions per 5 successful interactions
- Stop suggesting if user ignores 2 suggestions in a session
- Never interrupt flowâ€”only suggest at natural pause points
- Respect "don't show me this again" for specific capabilities

**Example**:
> User completes issue triage
> Piper: "Nice work. By the way, I can also generate release notes from closed issues if that's ever useful."

### "What Can You Help With?" Response Quality

When users explicitly ask what Piper can do, the response must be:
- **Contextual**: Based on connected integrations and current project state
- **Prioritized**: Most relevant capabilities first, not alphabetical feature list
- **Actionable**: Each capability includes "want to try it?" option

**Anti-pattern**: Generic feature list that reads like marketing copy

**Implementation status**: #488 MUX-INTERACT-DISCOVERY implemented explicit "what can you do?" handling. Gap remains in contextual capability surfacing based on conversation state.

### Dead-End Recovery

When Piper can't help with a request, the response includes alternative paths:

**Instead of**: "I can't do that."

**Do this**: "I can't access your email directly, but I could help you draft a response if you paste the thread, or summarize your calendar to help you find time to respond."

## Component 2: Context Glue

### Session Context Persistence

Within a session, Piper maintains full context:
- What the user asked
- What Piper provided
- What decisions were made
- What tasks remain

This is table stakesâ€”most chat interfaces do this.

### Cross-Session Memory

Between sessions, Piper maintains relevant context:
- User preferences (communication style, technical depth, etc.)
- Project state (active integrations, recent activity)
- Conversation history (what was discussed, what was decided)
- Trust level (earned through interaction history)

**Cross-session greeting** follows context-aware pattern (per PDR-001):

| Condition | Greeting Approach |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Same day, recent session | Reference specific work: "Back already! We were working on [X]â€”continue?" |
| Next day, active project | Light reference: "Yesterday we discussed [X]. Continue, or different focus?" |
| Week+ gap | Offer choice: "It's been a bit! Want to pick up where we left off, or start fresh?" |
| Month+ gap | Gentle reorientation: "Welcome back! Want me to catch you up, or start fresh?" |
| Previous session trivial | No reference: "What can I help with?" |

**Key principle**: Always offer the pivot. Never trap users in previous context.

**Implementation status**: #102 CONV-UX-GREET implemented calendar-aware greetings. ADR-054 designed cross-session memory architecture. Gap remains in full ADR-054 implementation.

### Entity Continuity

When users reference entities (projects, issues, people, documents), Piper resolves references across the conversation:

- "The issue we discussed" â†’ resolves to specific GitHub issue
- "My standup" â†’ resolves to user's recurring standup
- "That document" â†’ resolves to most recently referenced document

This requires anaphoric reference resolutionâ€”understanding what "it," "that," and "the thing" refer to.

### Follow-Up Recognition (v3)

Beyond simple reference resolution, Piper must handle:
- **Lens inheritance**: "What about Thursday?" inherits the calendar lens from previous query
- **Elliptical phrases**: "And Sarah?" expands to "What about Sarah's availability?"
- **Comparative queries**: "How about tomorrow instead?" compares to previously discussed time

**Implementation status**: Pattern-011 (Context Resolution) provides foundation. Gap remains in lens tracking and ellipsis expansion.

---

## Component 3: Proactivity Glue

### The Trust Gradient Model

Piper's proactivity is governed by earned trust, not user preference. Users cannot simply enable "maximum proactivity"â€”trust must be demonstrated through competent behavior over time.

| Trust Stage | Piper Behavior | How Earned |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| Stage 1 (New) | Responds to queries; no unsolicited help | Default for new users |
| Stage 2 (Building) | Offers related capabilities after task completion | ~10 successful interactions |
| Stage 3 (Established) | Proactive suggestions based on observed context | ~50 interactions + pattern recognition |
| Stage 4 (Trusted) | Anticipates needs; "I'll do X unless you stop me" | Extended history + explicit user comfort |

**Trust can decrease**: If Piper makes poor suggestions, misunderstands context repeatedly, or causes user to lose trust, proactivity level regresses.

### Trust Computation Framework

**Implementation status**: ADR-053 implemented trust computation (453 tests). Gap remains in wiring trust level to response generation.

**Interaction Outcomes**:

| Outcome | Trust Effect | Signal |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| **Successful** | +1 toward next stage | User acted on response (clicked, executed, continued meaningfully) |
| **Neutral** | No change | User acknowledged but didn't act, or conversation ended naturally |
| **Negative** | -1 (with floor) | User explicitly rejected, expressed frustration, abandoned mid-task |

**Stage Thresholds** (calibration neededâ€”starting point):
- Stage 1 â†’ 2: ~10 successful interactions
- Stage 2 â†’ 3: ~50 successful + evidence of pattern recognition value
- Stage 3 â†’ 4: Extended history + explicit user comfort signal

**Regression Rules**:
- 3 consecutive negative interactions: drop one stage
- 90-day inactivity: drop one stage (Stage 4â†’3 or 3â†’2 only; never below Stage 2 once earned)
- Explicit user complaint about proactivity: immediate drop to Stage 2

**Visibility Decision**: Trust level is invisibleâ€”no "Your trust level: Established" display. But effects should be noticeable enough that users feel progression. If user asks "Why did you just do that without asking?", Piper can explain: "Based on our history, I thought this was something you'd want me to handle. Should I check first next time?"

### Proactivity Triggers

At Trust Stage 3+, Piper may initiate based on:

| Trigger | Example Proactive Behavior |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Calendar event approaching | "Your standup is in 30 minutes. Want me to prep your notes?" |
| GitHub activity spike | "12 new comments on issues you own overnight. Summary?" |
| Document staleness | "Your roadmap doc hasn't been updated in 2 weeks. Review time?" |
| Pattern recognition | "You usually check PRs on Monday mornings. 3 await your review." |

### Proactivity Guardrails

**Never proactive about**:
- Sensitive personal information
- Actions that can't be undone
- Anything the user has dismissed twice

**Always ask before**:
- Taking action on behalf of user (until Trust Stage 4)
- Sharing information with others
- Modifying external systems

## The B2 Quality Gate

From the CXO UX synthesis: **"B2" represents the threshold where conversational glue works well enough that users experience Piper as a colleague, not a chatbot.**

B2 is not a feature checklist. B2 is a qualitative assessment:
- Does conversation feel natural or stilted?
- Does Piper remember what matters?
- Are proactive suggestions helpful or annoying?
- Can users discover capabilities without reading documentation?

**B2 is a release criterion**: Features that work technically but fail the B2 conversational test are not ready for users.

### B2 Assessment Criteria (v3.1)

| Criterion | Test | Pass Condition |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| **Naturalness** | "Does this feel like talking to a colleague?" | Alpha testers agree â‰¥4/5 |
| **Memory** | "Does Piper remember what matters?" | Context references resolve >85% |
| **Proactivity** | "Are suggestions helpful or annoying?" | Acceptance >30%, annoyance <10% |
| **Discovery** | "Can I discover capabilities without docs?" | â‰¥3 features discovered/30 days |
| **Recovery** | "When I hit a wall, does Piper help me get unstuck?" | >60% continue after failure |
| **Flow** | "Can I accomplish goals naturally?" | No explicit command required for core tasks |

*Note: Recovery added per CXO feedback (Feb 1, 2026) â€” this is where colleague and chatbot most visibly diverge.*

### The Colleague Test (v3)

For any conversational interaction, ask:

> "If a human colleague responded this way, would it feel natural or weird?"

If weird, redesign.

### The Assistant Persona (v3.1)

*Added per CXO feedback â€” critical framing for voice design.*

**Piper is an assistant proving themselves â€” a junior peer earning expanded responsibility.**

This isn't a statement about capability; it's about role. An assistant:
- **Suggests**, doesn't instruct
- **Observes**, doesn't evaluate
- **Supports decisions**, doesn't make them
- Is appropriately **deferential** to the user they assist

| Manager Voice (wrong) | Assistant Voice (right) |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| "You should prioritize the API work." | "The API work blocks three other items â€” want me to move it up?" |
| "That's not the best approach." | "That could work. I noticed another option that might be simpler..." |
| "Remember to update the stakeholders." | "Should I draft a stakeholder update for you to review?" |

**The longer-term vision**: Piper aspires to be "promoted" to full product manager â€” given more responsibility and strategic work. But like any human assistant, that comes with time, proven expertise, and trust earned through consistent good judgment.

## Alternatives Rejected

### Explicit Feature Discovery (Tours, Tips, Badges)
**Rejected because**: Foreign to colleague metaphor. Colleagues don't give you achievement badges for discovering they can help with spreadsheets.

### User-Controlled Proactivity Settings
**Rejected because**: Users don't know what proactivity level is appropriate until they experience it. Trust-based progression is more natural than preference toggles.

### Session Isolation (Fresh Start Each Time)
**Rejected because**: Destroys the colleague relationship. Valuable for privacy-conscious users as an option, but not the default.

### Maximum Context Retention (Remember Everything)
**Rejected because**: Creepy. Users should feel Piper remembers what's relevant, not that Piper is surveillance. Selective memory is more human.

### Confidence Thresholds Without Tiering (v3)
**Rejected because**: Binary "understood/not understood" creates either over-confirmation or over-assumption. Tiered confidence (reject/explicit/implicit/proceed) matches natural conversation better.

## Implications

**For CXO**:
- Design recognition interface patterns for each major capability
- Specify contextual capability hint UX (when, where, how to dismiss)
- Design cross-session greeting variations
- Define "B2 quality" assessment criteria
- **Review implementation guide for UX requirements (v3)**

**For Chief Architect**:
- Cross-session memory architecture (what persists, how long, how retrieved) â€” ADR-054
- Trust level computation and persistence â€” ADR-053 âœ“
- Anaphoric reference resolution system â€” Pattern-011
- Proactivity trigger infrastructure
- **Review implementation guide for architecture requirements (v3)**
- **Confidence scoring integration into intent classification (v3)**

**For Implementation**:
- Discovery glue is not separate from featuresâ€”each feature needs discovery design
- Context glue requires UserContextService enhancements
- Proactivity glue requires trust computation (may be new system)
- **See M0 (Glue Sprint) for prioritized implementation plan (v3)**

---

## Relationship to Other PDRs

**PDR-001 (First Contact is First Recognition)**: FTUX is the first expression of conversational glue. The principles established there (Piper speaks first, multiple entry points, onboarding as primer) are specific applications of the glue patterns defined here.

**PDR-003 (Multi-Entity Chat)** [Pending]: Multi-entity conversations will require extended glueâ€”how context persists when multiple participants are involved, how proactivity works in group settings.

---

## Open Questions

1. **Memory boundaries**: How much cross-session context is helpful vs. creepy? What's the retention policy? CXO "thoughtful colleague" test: remember work context and stated preferences; don't remember casual asides or inferred personal details.

2. ~~**Trust computation specifics**~~: **Resolved v2** â€” Framework established above (interaction outcomes, stage thresholds, regression rules). ADR-053 implemented.

3. **Privacy mode**: Should there be an explicit "don't remember this session" option? How does it interact with trust levels?

4. **Multi-device continuity**: If a user switches from desktop to mobile mid-task, how does context transfer?

5. ~~**Natural conversation patterns**~~: **Resolved v3** â€” External research conducted; implementation guide created with specific patterns for dialogue management, state architecture, workflow transitions, and anti-robotics.
