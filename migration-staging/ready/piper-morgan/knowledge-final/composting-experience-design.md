# D3: Composting Experience Design

**Issue**: #431 MUX-VISION-LEARN
**Deliverable**: 3 of 7
**Question Addressed**: What do users see when objects decompose into learnings?

---

## Core Principle

**Composting is reflection, not surveillance.**

When Piper transforms old objects into learnings, users should experience this as thoughtful reflectionâ€”like a colleague who's "had time to think about things"â€”not as evidence of continuous monitoring.

---

## The "Filing Dreams" Metaphor

### Why This Metaphor

Humans process experiences during sleep, consolidating memories and extracting patterns. We call this "sleeping on it" or "letting it percolate." Piper's composting works similarly:

- Processing happens during "rest" (quiet hours)
- Patterns emerge from accumulated experience
- Insights surface as reflection, not real-time analysis

### What Users Experience

**User does NOT experience**:
- "I've been watching your behavior and noticed..."
- "While you were away, I analyzed..."
- "Based on my surveillance of your activities..."

**User DOES experience**:
- "Having had some time to reflect..."
- "Looking back on our recent work..."
- "Something occurred to me..."

---

## When Composting Happens

### Quiet Hours (Default: 2-5 AM local)

Composting runs during user's configured quiet hours:
- Mimics "sleeping on it"
- Doesn't interfere with active work
- Creates natural temporal separation between activity and reflection

### User Configuration

```
Piper Settings > Learning > Reflection Time

When should Piper reflect on recent work?
â—‹ Default (2-5 AM)
â—‹ Custom: [time picker]
â—‹ Never (disable background learning)
```

### Manual Trigger

Users can trigger reflection:
- "Take some time to reflect on [project/topic]"
- "What have you learned from our work this week?"

This runs composting on-demand, surfacing results immediately.

---

## Composting Output: Reflection Summaries

### Format

Reflection summaries are batched, periodic, and natural:

```
Good morning! I've had some time to reflect on our recent work.

A few things that occurred to me:

**About the Henderson project**
Looking back at how the proposal evolved, I noticed you refined the scope
three times before it felt right. That iterative approach seems to work
well for complex proposals. (high confidence)

**About your schedule**
The past two weeks had a lot of back-to-back meetings. On days when you
had buffer time between meetings, the follow-up tasks got done faster.
Might be worth protecting some transition time. (medium confidence)

Would you like to discuss any of these, or should I just keep them in mind?
```

### Key Characteristics

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Tone** | Reflective, colleague-like |
| **Timing** | Morning or at session start |
| **Volume** | 2-4 insights max per summary |
| **Opt-out** | User can skip: "not now" |
| **Follow-up** | Offers discussion, doesn't require it |

---

## Language Patterns

### Reflection Openers

Use these to introduce composting insights:

| Appropriate | Avoids |
|-------------|--------|
| "Having had time to think about it..." | "After analyzing your data..." |
| "Looking back on our work together..." | "Based on my observations..." |
| "Something occurred to me..." | "I detected a pattern..." |
| "I've been reflecting on..." | "I've been monitoring..." |
| "It strikes me that..." | "My analysis shows..." |

### Temporal Framing

**Good**: Implies reflection happened separately from activity
- "Looking back at last week..."
- "Thinking about how that project went..."
- "In hindsight..."

**Bad**: Implies real-time surveillance
- "I noticed you doing X yesterday..."
- "While you were working, I saw..."
- "I've been tracking..."

### Confidence Expression

**High confidence** (0.8+):
- "I've noticed that..." (no qualifier needed)
- "It's become clear that..."
- "A consistent pattern..."

**Medium confidence** (0.6-0.8):
- "It seems like..."
- "I think..."
- "This might be a pattern..."

**Low confidence** (0.4-0.6):
- "I'm not sure, but..."
- "It's possible that..."
- "Something to consider..."

## What Users See: Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Morning Standup Integration

Natural point for reflection summaries:

```
PIPER: Good morning! Here's what's on your radar today:
       [calendar, tasks, etc.]

       I've also had some time to reflect:
       - The quarterly planning seems to generate the most follow-up tasks
         on Fridays. Worth keeping that afternoon light?

       Ready to dive in?
```

**Key**: Reflection is offered, not forced. User can engage or move on.

### Scenario 2: Project Milestone Reflection

When a project reaches a significant point:

```
PIPER: The Henderson proposal just got approvedâ€”nice work!

       Looking back on how it came together, a few things stood out:
       - The early stakeholder alignment saved revision cycles later
       - The timeline buffer you built in absorbed the scope creep

       Want me to note these for future proposals, or is this project unique?
```

**Key**: Reflection tied to meaningful moment, not arbitrary timing.

### Scenario 3: Periodic Summary (Stage 3+)

Weekly or biweekly batched reflection:

```
PIPER: Weekly reflection (your Saturday morning digest)

       **Work patterns**
       This week had more reactive work than planned work. Might be worth
       looking at where the interruptions came from.

       **Meeting insights**
       The Tuesday all-hands seems to generate the most follow-up items.
       You usually capture them, but some slip.

       **Something new**
       I noticed a new collaboration pattern with the design teamâ€”more
       async, shorter feedback loops. Seems to be working well.

       [Acknowledge] [Discuss] [Not now]
```

### Scenario 4: User Asks for Reflection

On-demand composting:

```
USER: What have you learned from the last month?

PIPER: Let me think about that...

       [Brief pauseâ€”composting runs]

       Here's what stands out from the past month:

       **Productivity patterns**
       - Morning focus time is when the deep work happens
       - Thursdays tend to be your catch-up day
       - You're more responsive to Slack in the afternoon

       **Project insights**
       - The marketing launch had the tightest timeline but cleanest execution
       - Technical debt issues cluster around the end of sprints

       **Something I'm less sure about**
       - It seems like cross-team meetings drain more than same-team meetings,
         but I don't have enough data yet.

       What would you like to explore?
```

## Notification Rules

### What Gets Batched

| Event | Notification | Batch Into |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Single insight extracted | None | Weekly summary |
| Important pattern discovered | Brief mention | Morning standup |
| User correction affects multiple insights | Acknowledgment | Immediate (one message) |
| Composting cycle complete | None | Next natural touchpoint |

### What Gets Individual Attention

| Event | Treatment |
|-------|-----------|
| High-confidence insight directly relevant now | Contextual surfacing |
| Contradiction discovered (learning invalidates prior) | Proactive correction |
| User explicitly requests reflection | On-demand summary |

### Notification Cadence by Trust Level

| Trust Level | Reflection Frequency | Delivery |
|-------------|---------------------|----------|
| Stage 1 | None proactive | Pull only |
| Stage 2 | None proactive | Pull only |
| Stage 3 | Weekly or biweekly | Morning digest |
| Stage 4 | As relevant | Contextual + digest |

---

## Composting Transparency

### Users Can Ask

- "What are you reflecting on?"
- "What's in your composting queue?"
- "When do you process learnings?"

### Honest Answers

```
USER: What are you reflecting on?

PIPER: Right now I have 23 objects from the past two weeks that are ready
       for compostingâ€”mostly completed tasks, closed issues, and finished
       conversations.

       When I process them (tonight during my quiet time), I'll look for:
       - Patterns in how work got done
       - Recurring themes or concerns
       - Things that might inform future suggestions

       Anything specific you'd like me to pay attention to?
```

### What Users Cannot See

- Raw composting algorithms
- Individual object decomposition details
- Pre-processed session data

**Rationale**: These are implementation details that would be confusing and create false precision. Users see outcomes (insights), not process.

---

## Anti-Patterns: What NOT to Do

### 1. Real-Time Notification of Learning

**Wrong**:
```
PIPER: [3:42 PM] I just learned that you prefer bullet points!
PIPER: [3:45 PM] Pattern detected: afternoon email checking
PIPER: [3:51 PM] New insight: meeting fatigue threshold identified
```

**Why wrong**: Feels like surveillance. Learning should be invisible until reflection.

### 2. Surveillance Language

**Wrong**:
```
PIPER: While monitoring your activities this week, I observed...
```

**Why wrong**: "Monitoring" and "observed" imply active surveillance.

### 3. Over-Detailed Attribution

**Wrong**:
```
PIPER: Based on your behavior at 2:15 PM on Tuesday, when you closed
       the browser tab after 3.2 seconds of viewing the report...
```

**Why wrong**: Too specific. Creates discomfort. Reflection should be general.

### 4. Unexplained Behavioral Changes

**Wrong**:
[Piper suddenly starts behaving differently based on learning, without ever surfacing that it learned something]

**Why wrong**: Feels like manipulation. Even if not announced, changes should be explainable on request.

### 5. Guilt-Inducing Reflection

**Wrong**:
```
PIPER: I noticed you didn't follow through on 12 commitments this month.
       Your completion rate has dropped 23% since Q1.
```

**Why wrong**: Reflection should help, not judge. Frame constructively or not at all.

## Configuration Options

### What Users Can Configure

| Setting | Options | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Quiet hours | Time range | 2-5 AM local |
| Reflection frequency | Daily/Weekly/Biweekly/Never | Weekly (Stage 3+) |
| Reflection delivery | Morning standup/Dedicated message/Never | Standup |
| Manual composting | Enabled/Disabled | Enabled |

### What Users Cannot Configure

- Whether composting happens at all (it's core to learning)
- Composting algorithms
- What gets composted

**Rationale**: Composting is how Piper learns. Disabling it disables learning. Instead, users control visibility (D1) and can delete results (D2).

---

## Success Metrics

This specification succeeds if:

- [ ] Users describe composting as "reflection" not "monitoring"
- [ ] Reflection summaries feel natural, not robotic
- [ ] Users don't feel interrupted by learning notifications
- [ ] Users report insights feel "earned" not "creepy"
- [ ] Morning standup integration feels seamless

## CXO Review Notes (2026-01-23)

**Status**: âœ… Approved

### Refinements to Apply

1. **Vary reflection phrasing** - Don't rely on a single opener. Rotate through:
   - "Having had some time to reflect..."
   - "Something occurred to me..."
   - "I've been thinking about..."
   - "Looking back at our work together..."

   All suggest organic reflection rather than scheduled analysis.

2. **The "filing dreams" metaphor solves the creepiness problem**: Users don't want to know Piper is "working on them" while they sleep. But they're comfortable with the idea that Piper, like them, has quiet hours where thoughts settle. This is consciousness design, not just UX.

### Implementation Notes

- Implement phrase rotation in composting output templates
- Avoid any single opener becoming formulaic
- Test that users experience "reflection" not "monitoring"
