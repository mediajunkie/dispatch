# ADR-038: Spatial Intelligence Architecture Patterns

**Date**: September 30, 2025 (Updated: October 1, 2025)
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: CORE-GREAT-2C Verification Work (GitHub Issue #194), CORE-GREAT-2D Discovery (GitHub Issue #195)
**Supersedes**: None
**Superseded by**: None

---

## Decision

Piper Morgan will support **three distinct spatial intelligence patterns** optimized for different integration domains:

1. **Granular Adapter Pattern** for complex coordination scenarios
2. **Embedded Intelligence Pattern** for streamlined knowledge management
3. **Delegated MCP Pattern** for Model Context Protocol integrations (NEW - Oct 1, 2025)

All patterns are considered first-class architectural approaches, and new integrations should choose the pattern most appropriate for their domain.

---

## Context

During CORE-GREAT-2C verification work (Phases 1-2, September 30, 2025), we discovered that Slack and Notion integrations implement fundamentally different but equally valid spatial architecture approaches.

During CORE-GREAT-2D investigation (Phase 0, October 1, 2025), we discovered Calendar implements a third distinct pattern using Model Context Protocol (MCP) delegation.

### Slack Implementation (Granular Adapter Pattern)

- **Structure**: 11 files (6 core + 5 tests)
- **Location**: `services/integrations/slack/spatial_*.py`
- **Access**: `router.get_spatial_adapter() â†’ SlackSpatialAdapter`
- **Inheritance**: Extends `BaseSpatialAdapter`
- **Components**: Types, Adapter, Agent, Classifier, Mapper, Memory
- **Use Case**: Real-time messaging coordination

### Notion Implementation (Embedded Intelligence Pattern)

- **Structure**: 1 comprehensive file (632 lines)
- **Location**: `services/intelligence/spatial/notion_spatial.py`
- **Access**: Separate `NotionSpatialIntelligence` class using router internally
- **Inheritance**: Standalone class (no base adapter)
- **Components**: Single comprehensive intelligence class
- **Use Case**: Knowledge management and semantic analysis

### Calendar Implementation (Delegated MCP Pattern) - NEW

- **Structure**: 2 files (router + MCP adapter)
- **Location**: Split between `services/integrations/calendar/` (router) and `services/mcp/consumer/` (adapter)
- **Access**: `router.method()` delegates to MCP adapter
- **Inheritance**: MCP adapter extends `BaseSpatialAdapter`
- **Components**: Minimal router + comprehensive MCP adapter (499 lines)
- **Use Case**: Temporal awareness and calendar operations via Model Context Protocol

### Verification Results

- âœ… Slack spatial: 11 files, 100% operational, 66 test functions passing
- âœ… Notion spatial: 1 file, 100% operational, 8-dimensional analysis working
- âœ… Calendar spatial: 2 files, 100% operational, MCP protocol integration
- âœ… All patterns: Support 8-dimensional spatial metaphor
- âœ… Zero conflicts: Patterns coexist successfully
- âœ… Feature flags: All support USE*SPATIAL*\* control
- âœ… Production-proven: All operational in production codebase

---

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Standardize on Single Pattern (REJECTED)

Force all integrations to use the same architectural approach.

**Advantages**:

- Single pattern to learn and maintain
- Consistent codebase structure
- Easier onboarding for new developers

**Disadvantages**:

- Wrong tool for some domains (over-engineering or under-engineering)
- Performance penalties for mismatched patterns
- Maintenance burden (either too complex or too inflexible)
- Discards validated, working implementations
- **Rejected**: Both patterns are production-proven and domain-optimized

### Option 2: Support Multiple Patterns (CHOSEN)

Allow domain-optimized architectures based on integration characteristics.

**Advantages**:

- Optimal performance for each domain
- Appropriate complexity levels
- Proven operational in production
- Clear selection criteria
- Flexibility for future integrations
- Support for MCP-based integrations (Oct 2025 update)

**Disadvantages**:

- Multiple patterns to maintain (now 3 patterns as of Oct 2025)
- Documentation overhead
- Training requirement for developers

**Decision**: CHOSEN - Benefits outweigh costs. October 2025 update: Calendar's Delegated MCP Pattern confirms this approach scales well for protocol-based integrations.

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (REJECTED)

Combine both patterns in single implementation (e.g., granular components with embedded access).

**Advantages**:

- Theoretically "best of both worlds"
- Single architectural style

**Disadvantages**:

- Complexity without clear benefit
- Unclear which pattern to follow
- No production validation
- Maintenance burden of both approaches
- **Rejected**: Adds complexity without solving real problems

---

## Decision Rationale

### Core Principle: Domain-Optimized Architecture

**Key Insight**: Domain-specific optimization outweighs standardization for standardization's sake.

Different integration domains have fundamentally different spatial requirements:

**Reactive Coordination (Slack)**:

- Real-time event processing
- Multiple interaction types (messages, threads, reactions, etc.)
- Complex state management across channels/workspaces
- Need for fine-grained component testing
- **Solution**: Granular Adapter Pattern (11 files, component-based)

**Analytical Intelligence (Notion)**:

- Batch processing of knowledge structures
- Single comprehensive analytical model
- Stable domain with clear requirements
- Performance-critical operations
- **Solution**: Embedded Intelligence Pattern (1 file, consolidated)

### Evidence-Based Decision

**Production Validation**:

- Both patterns verified operational (GREAT-2C Phases 1-2)
- Zero conflicts between patterns
- 100% feature parity (8-dimensional spatial metaphor)
- Complete test coverage (66 tests Slack, integration tests Notion)

**Architectural Quality**:

- Slack: Clean component separation, extensive test coverage
- Notion: Consolidated design, lower overhead, direct access
- Both: Feature flag control, async/await patterns, observability

**Developer Experience**:

- Clear selection criteria documented
- Pattern choice based on objective factors
- Both patterns have proven track record

## Implementation

### Pattern Selection Criteria

New spatial integrations must choose pattern based on:

1. **Domain Complexity**:

   - Many distinct capabilities (>5) â†’ Granular
   - Few focused capabilities (â‰¤5) â†’ Embedded
   - **MCP Protocol required** â†’ Delegated MCP (Oct 2025)

2. **Requirement Stability**:

   - Evolving requirements â†’ Granular (easier to extend)
   - Stable requirements â†’ Embedded (lower overhead)
   - **Protocol-driven** â†’ Delegated MCP

3. **Performance Criticality**:

   - Performance critical â†’ Embedded (minimal overhead)
   - Performance adequate â†’ Either pattern
   - **External service** â†’ Delegated MCP (protocol overhead acceptable)

4. **Testing Requirements**:

   - Component-level isolation needed â†’ Granular
   - Integration-level testing sufficient â†’ Embedded
   - **Protocol compliance testing** â†’ Delegated MCP

5. **Team Structure**:

   - Multiple developers on feature â†’ Granular (parallel work)
   - Single developer or small team â†’ Embedded (simpler)
   - **MCP team + integration team** â†’ Delegated MCP (separation of concerns)

6. **Domain Nature**:

   - Reactive coordination â†’ Granular
   - Analytical intelligence â†’ Embedded
   - **Temporal/contextual awareness via protocol** â†’ Delegated MCP

7. **Integration Architecture** (NEW - Oct 2025):
   - **Model Context Protocol (MCP) required** â†’ Delegated MCP
   - **Separate consumer layer exists** â†’ Delegated MCP
   - **Protocol-specific spatial logic** â†’ Delegated MCP
   - All other cases â†’ Granular or Embedded

### Pattern Descriptions

#### Granular Adapter Pattern

**When to Use**:

- Complex coordination scenarios
- Real-time messaging and events
- Multi-faceted spatial requirements
- Requirements likely to evolve
- Multiple developers working on spatial features

**Structure**:

```
services/integrations/{integration}/
  spatial_types.py          # Domain types and primitives
  spatial_adapter.py        # Main adapter (inherits BaseSpatialAdapter)
  spatial_agent.py          # Navigation and awareness
  spatial_intent_classifier.py  # Intent classification
  spatial_mapper.py         # Domain-specific mapping
  spatial_memory.py         # Memory storage/retrieval
  tests/
    test_spatial_*.py       # Component-level tests
```

**Access Pattern**:

```python
router = IntegrationRouter()
adapter = router.get_spatial_adapter()
result = await adapter.map_to_position(context)
```

#### Embedded Intelligence Pattern

**When to Use**:

- Knowledge management scenarios
- Semantic analysis and content processing
- Streamlined spatial requirements
- Stable, well-defined domain
- Performance-critical applications
- Single comprehensive model fits domain

**Structure**:

```
services/intelligence/spatial/{integration}_spatial.py
  # Single comprehensive class
  # 8-dimensional analysis methods
  # Built-in analytics tracking
  # Internal router usage
```

**Access Pattern**:

```python
spatial = IntegrationSpatialIntelligence()
await spatial.connect()
analysis = await spatial.get_comprehensive_spatial_analysis(item_id)
```

#### Delegated MCP Pattern (NEW - Oct 2025)

**When to Use**:

- Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations
- External service adapters requiring protocol compliance
- Temporal or contextual awareness scenarios
- Services with separate consumer layer architecture
- Integrations where spatial logic is protocol-specific

**Structure**:

```
services/integrations/{integration}/
  {integration}_integration_router.py  # Minimal router (delegation only)

services/mcp/consumer/
  {integration}_adapter.py             # MCP adapter (inherits BaseSpatialAdapter)
    # Spatial intelligence implementation
    # MCP protocol compliance
    # Custom spatial context extraction
```

**Access Pattern**:

```python
router = IntegrationRouter()
# Router methods delegate to MCP adapter
events = await router.get_todays_events()
# Spatial methods also available
context = router.get_context(external_id)
```

**Key Characteristics**:

- Router is minimal (mostly pass-through methods)
- Spatial intelligence in MCP consumer layer
- MCP adapter inherits from `BaseSpatialAdapter`
- Protocol-specific spatial context extraction
- Clean separation: integration routing vs MCP protocol

**Example**: Calendar integration

- Router: `services/integrations/calendar/calendar_integration_router.py` (397 lines)
- MCP Adapter: `services/mcp/consumer/google_calendar_adapter.py` (499 lines)
- Custom spatial context for temporal awareness (meeting_type, duration, attendees, location)

### Common Requirements

All spatial patterns **must**:

1. **Router Integration**:

   - Use IntegrationRouter (directly or indirectly)
   - Support feature flag control (USE*SPATIAL*\*)
   - Provide health check capabilities
   - **Update Oct 2025**: Delegated MCP Pattern delegates through router to MCP adapter

2. **8-Dimensional Spatial Metaphor**:

   - Implement relevant dimensions for domain
   - Use consistent naming (HIERARCHY, TEMPORAL, PRIORITY, COLLABORATIVE, FLOW, QUANTITATIVE, CAUSAL, CONTEXTUAL)
   - Document which dimensions supported
   - **Update Oct 2025**: Calendar implements TEMPORAL dimension via temporal_summary

3. **Backward Compatibility**:

   - Graceful degradation when spatial disabled
   - Don't break existing functionality
   - Support legacy mode via feature flags
   - **Update Oct 2025**: All 3 patterns support feature flag control

4. **Async Patterns**:

   - Use async/await for I/O operations
   - Support concurrent operations where appropriate
   - Handle cleanup properly

5. **Observability**:
   - Log spatial operations appropriately
   - Track analytics/metrics
   - Support debugging and troubleshooting
   - **Update Oct 2025**: Delegated MCP Pattern includes circuit breaker pattern for resilience

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Optimal Performance**: Each integration uses pattern suited to its needs
2. **Appropriate Complexity**: No over-engineering or under-engineering
3. **Production-Proven**: Both patterns validated and operational
4. **Clear Guidance**: Selection criteria documented
5. **Flexibility**: Future integrations can choose appropriate pattern
6. **No Breaking Changes**: Both existing patterns continue working

### Negative Consequences

1. **Multiple Patterns**: Two patterns to maintain instead of one
2. **Documentation Overhead**: Must document both patterns
3. **Training**: Developers need to understand pattern selection
4. **Consistency Risk**: Must ensure both patterns follow core requirements

### Mitigation Strategies

**For Multiple Patterns**:

- Clear documentation of both patterns
- Decision framework for pattern selection
- Common requirements enforced across patterns

**For Documentation Overhead**:

- Comprehensive pattern guide created (`docs/architecture/spatial-intelligence-patterns.md`)
- Pattern comparison table
- Usage examples for both patterns

**For Training**:

- Selection criteria clearly documented
- Decision framework provides objective guidance
- Examples from production code (Slack, Notion)

**For Consistency**:

- Common requirements documented (router integration, 8-dimensional metaphor, etc.)
- Feature flag system consistent across patterns
- Observability standards apply to both

## Update October 2025

See **ADR-034: Plugin Architecture Implementation** for the plugin system that now manages all spatial intelligence integrations. The three spatial patterns documented in this ADR are now implemented as plugins following the Wrapper/Adapter pattern, providing:

- **Dynamic loading** and configuration control via `config/PIPER.user.md`
- **Lifecycle management** through the `PluginRegistry`
- **Performance validation** with <0.05ms overhead per spatial operation
- **Contract testing** ensuring all spatial integrations comply with `PiperPlugin` interface

All spatial intelligence patterns remain valid architectural choices, now enhanced with plugin capabilities.
