# Ship #030 â€” Workstream Review Draft
## Week of February 6-12, 2026
**Draft by**: Chief of Staff (from omnibus logs Feb 6-12)
**Status**: DRAFT â€” Awaiting leadership comments and PM input
**For discussion**: Saturday Feb 14

## Summary

A week shaped by PM illness (flu, days 1-7+) that nonetheless produced significant output across all workstreams. The week opened with a HIGH-VELOCITY Friday (13 issues closed, v0.8.5.2 released) and closed with quality-focused process improvements (narrative verification, Windows CI). Between those bookends: website strategy crystallized, critical file recovery averted data loss, a new alpha tester onboarded, and two releases shipped. The theme might be something like "the infrastructure holds" â€” the cathedral metaphor made literal, as agents continued productive work even with PM at reduced capacity.

## ðŸŽ¯ Product & experience

**Website strategy crystallized (Feb 8)**. CXO + Comms collaborated to resolve three foundational framing questions: audience segmentation (journey followers / methodology learners / potential users), site-product relationship (pipermorgan.ai = consumer-facing, app.pipermorgan.ai = hosted), and CTA hierarchy (Try Piper â†’ Get Involved â†’ Learn More). Hero messaging explored using Ted Nadeau's Why-Molecule framework. Core positioning insight articulated: "PM tools assume work is items in lists. But PM work is actually relationships between concerns at different scales."

**Website redesign implemented (Feb 9)**. Web Developer executed complete redesign in 5 phases with 4 new pages. PM reviewed and captured screenshots for feedback (Feb 10). Styling adjustments pending.

**History Sidebar resolved (Feb 6)**. Investigation confirmed both sidebars call the same API. CXO provided flattening response for redundancy removal.

**New alpha tester onboarding (Feb 12)**. Dominique Derosena (Justin Maxwell's colleague) began setup â€” immediately hit a Windows batch file bug, which triggered broader Windows gap analysis.

## âš™ï¸ Engineering & architecture

**Two releases shipped**:
- **v0.8.5.2** (Feb 6): 4 alpha bugs fixed including cross-user session bleed discovery â€” a P0 security issue found via History Sidebar cascade investigation
- **v0.8.5.3** (Feb 11): All 14 Ted Nadeau Windows testing issues resolved in single Lead Dev session

**Critical file recovery (Feb 11)**. Routine ADR link audit (prompted by Ted's feedback) revealed ~2,155 files missing from dev/ (87% loss). Root cause: likely destructive git command on gitignored files around Feb 7-8. Recovery: 2,781 files restored from git history. Post-recovery cleanup reduced dev/ from 5.1 GB to ~1.2 GB.

**Windows CI infrastructure (Feb 12)**. Dominique's setup failure exposed pre-existing batch file bug from December 2025. Led to creation of Windows CI testing infrastructure and broader gap analysis for cross-platform support.

**ADR link integrity (Feb 11)**. Audit of 63 ADRs found 7 broken links across 3 files. All fixed. Link integrity checking added to weekly docs audit (#793).

**Issues closed**: ~27+ across the week (13 on Feb 6, 14 Windows issues on Feb 11, plus misc)

## ðŸ”¬ Methodology & process innovation

**Narrative Verification Skill created (Feb 12)**. Comms Director fact-checked "The Drift We Didn't See" draft against source logs and discovered systematic confabulation: invented numbers, wrong timelines, false causality chains. This led to `skill-narrative-verification-v1.md` with pre-draft facts extraction, verification checkpoints, and red flags for common fabrication patterns. Core principle: "Placeholders are safeguards, not clutter."

**close-issue-properly skill v1.1 (Feb 9)**. Failure mode observed: agent closed issue with comment only, leaving description checkboxes unchecked (Comment-Only Close anti-pattern). Skill updated with mandatory pre-flight checklist and explicit warnings.

**Role-address priming discovery (Feb 8)**. PM observed that addressing an agent by role name in the opening message ("Good afternoon, CIO!") triggers briefing context refresh, reinforcing role identity. Already practiced in Claude Code; now confirmed in Claude.ai. Candidate for best-practice documentation.

**HOSR role drift detected (Feb 8)**. HOSR session log deviated from naming convention and used wrong title ("Head of Stakeholder Relations" vs. correct "Head of Sapient Resources"). Diagnosed as likely context compaction artifact in long-running Opus 4.5 chat. Decision: migrate HOSR to fresh Opus 4.6 instance.

## ðŸŒ External relations & community

**Publications (3)**:
- "Entities Experience Moments in Time" (Medium + LinkedIn, Feb 8)
- "The Calendar That Wasn't Mine" (Medium, Feb 10)
- Ship #029 "The Foundation Hardens" (newsletter, Feb 11/12)

**Editorial process work (Feb 12)**:
- 22 unpublished insight drafts indexed and summarized for calendar planning
- Narrative verification process established (see Methodology above)
- Weekend editorial calendar being planned

**Alpha tester activity**:
- Ted Nadeau: Comprehensive profile created, 14 Windows issues extracted and all resolved, ongoing correspondence
- Cindy Chastain: Collaborator profile created, podcast plan advancing
- Michelle Hertzfeld: Re-engaged, wants to try latest builds
- Dominique Derosena: New tester (Justin Maxwell's colleague), began onboarding Feb 12
- Justin Maxwell: Provided colleague's email for alpha invite
- Jake Krajewski: Call rescheduled (PM illness)

**CIO ethics analysis (Feb 8)**. Analyzed Dan Heck/TUG ethics framework transcripts. Identified vocabulary enrichments ("warranted trust") and validated alignment with Piper's ethical architecture.

**[PM to fill in]**: Human-side context on Ted correspondence, Cindy podcast specifics, any other external interactions.

## ðŸ“Š Governance & operations

**Chief of Staff transition (Feb 7-8)**. Opus 4.5 â†’ Opus 4.6 migration completed with handoff memo from predecessor. Five weeks of collaboration history preserved. Orientation from omnibus logs and briefing documents.

**HOSR migration decision (Feb 8)**. Role drift observation led to decision to migrate HOSR to fresh Opus 4.6 chat. Pending execution.

**BRIEFING-CURRENT-STATE refresh (Feb 9)**. Document was 13 days stale â€” pattern count, version, and progress all updated. Now reflects Position 4.4, v0.8.5.2, 61 patterns.

**Citation archaeology (Feb 8)**. Docs agent scanned 117 omnibus logs for citation gaps, updating CITATIONS.md for first time since October.

**Staggered audit calendar**: Documentation audit completed Feb 9, next due March 9.

### Metrics

| Metric | This Week | Last Week |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Issues closed | ~27+ | ~21 |
| Releases | 2 (v0.8.5.2, v0.8.5.3) | 1 (v0.8.5.1) |
| Blog posts published | 3 | [PM to confirm] |
| Alpha testers active | 3 (Ted, Dominique, Michelle re-engaged) | 1 (Ted) |
| Patterns | 61 (no change) | 61 |
| ADRs | 61 (no change) | 61 |
| Skills | 6 (+1 narrative verification) | 5 |
| Test suite | 5200+ | 5268 |

**Health note**: PM has been fighting flu all week (days 1-7+). Velocity deliberately reduced. Multiple calls rescheduled. Despite this, infrastructure and agents maintained productive output â€” the strongest evidence yet that the continuity infrastructure works.

## Open questions for leadership review

1. **Theme suggestion**: "The Infrastructure Holds" or "The Cathedral in Winter" â€” reflecting productive output despite PM reduced capacity. Other suggestions welcome.
2. **Learning pattern**: Leading candidates are (a) Narrative Verification / confabulation discovery, (b) Role-address priming, (c) Infrastructure resilience during PM illness. Which resonates most?
3. **Ship length**: PM has flagged that ships are getting long. Input on what to cut vs. restructure appreciated.
4. **Anything missing?** Each role: flag if this draft missed something significant from your domain.
