## Outstanding Work

### Immediate (Required)

**1. Metadata for 4 Recent Posts**
These posts were published after the Oct 15 session and need manual classification:

| Post | Missing Fields |
|------|----------------|
| "When 75% Turns Out to Mean 100%" | imageSlug, category, cluster, workDate |
| "The Agent That Saved Me From Shipping 69%" | imageSlug, category, cluster, workDate |
| "The Great Refactor: Six Weeks in Eighteen Days" | imageSlug, category, cluster, workDate |
| "The Calm After the Storm: When Victory Means Stopping to Plan" | imageSlug, category, cluster, workDate |

**Effort**: 30 minutes

**2. Merge Phase 5 Branch**
Branch `claude/read-content-01NG5ZjR1PRDs14bxPSyL3U3` contains:
- Publishing workflow automation scripts
- CSV validation tools
- Enhanced RSS warnings

**Effort**: 15 minutes

### Short-term (Recommended)

**3. Data Cleanup**
- 64 posts flagged as missing imageSlug in validation
- Date format normalization (91 chatDates in M/D/YYYY format)
- Image file existence verification

**Effort**: 1-2 hours

**4. Episode Rebalancing**
Episode 12 ("production-transformation") has 30 posts (2.7Ã— average).
Recommendation: Split into 2-3 smaller episodes for better navigation.

**Effort**: 2-3 hours

**5. Navigation Bug Fixes**
Category/episode filters reportedly break next/back navigation.

**Effort**: 1-2 hours

### Medium-term (Optional)

**6. Phase 11: Design Polish** (4-6 hours)
- Blog detail page design refinement
- Typography hierarchy improvements
- Accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Mobile optimization

**7. Phases 12-15: Advanced Features** (17-27 hours total)
- Phase 12: Content engagement (related posts, TOC)
- Phase 13: Usability testing
- Phase 14: Performance optimization
- Phase 15: Analytics dashboard

## Architectural Decisions Made

### CSV as Source of Truth
- **Location**: `/data/blog-metadata.csv`
- **Flow**: CSV â†’ JSON â†’ Website
- **11 Fields**: slug, hashId, title, chatDate, imageSlug, workDate, pubDate, category, cluster, featured, notes
- **Git-tracked**: Full version history

### Dual Timestamp System
- **workDate**: When content was actually created (canonical ordering)
- **pubDate**: When published on Medium (freshness indicator)
- **Rationale**: Story was backfilled, work dates reflect true timeline

### Category Taxonomy
- **Building**: Narrative posts (building-in-public story) - ~81%
- **Insight**: Standalone lessons/frameworks - ~19%
- **Binary**: No tags, just two categories

### Episode Structure
- **12 episodes** spanning June 27 - October 12, 2025
- **Named periods**: "Genesis & Architecture" through "Reflection & Evolution"
- **Purpose**: Makes 160+ posts navigable, tells story arc

### Featured Post Selection
- **Hybrid Strategy**:
  1. Primary: Manual selection (CSV `featured=true`)
  2. Fallback: Most recent by work date
- **Current**: Using fallback (no manual selection yet)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

4. **Run data cleanup** using new tooling
5. **Fix navigation bugs** with category/episode filters
6. **Consider episode rebalancing** for Episode 12

### Strategic Considerations
