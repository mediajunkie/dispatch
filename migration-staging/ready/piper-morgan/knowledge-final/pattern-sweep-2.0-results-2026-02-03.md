|--------|-------|
| Patterns Analyzed | 60 |
| New Patterns in Period | 10 (050-059) |
| TRUE EMERGENCE Candidates | 2 |
| Anti-Patterns Indexed | 43 (was 42) |

## Phase 2: Multi-Lens Analysis

Four parallel agents completed analysis:

### Agent B: Usage Analyst
**Deliverable**: `dev/active/pattern-usage-analysis.md`
**Status**: âœ… Complete

**Top 5 Most-Used Patterns**:
1. Pattern-045 (Green Tests, Red User) - 28 mentions
2. Pattern-049 (Audit Cascade) - 16 mentions
3. Pattern-020 (Spatial Metaphor Integration) - 11 mentions
4. Pattern-046 (Beads Completion Discipline) - 10 mentions
5. Pattern-047 (Time Lord Alert) - 8 mentions

**Dormant Patterns**: 39 patterns with no explicit mentions (note: dormant â‰  unused per Meta-Pattern 3)

### Agent C: Novelty Detector
**Deliverable**: `dev/active/pattern-novelty-candidates.md`
**Status**: âœ… Complete

**TRUE EMERGENCE Candidates (2)**:
1. **Cascade Investigation** - When fixing a bug, systematically audit the entire category for similar issues
   - Evidence: Feb 1 session (1 todo bug â†’ 15 issues discovered)
   - Recommendation: Propose as Pattern-060

2. **Design Archaeology** - Systematic excavation of design decisions before proposing changes
   - Evidence: Feb 1 Special Assignments session
   - Recommendation: Propose as Pattern-061

**FALSE POSITIVE Results**:
- Staggered Audit Calendar: Existing operational documentation
- Clustering for Efficiency: Variant of Pattern-038
- Health Check Dashboard: Pattern combination, not new pattern

### Agent D: Evolution Tracker
**Deliverable**: `dev/active/pattern-evolution-report.md`
**Status**: âœ… Complete

**Patterns Added This Period**: 10
- Grammar Application family (050-058): Jan 21-22
- Leadership Caucus (059): Jan 26

**Lifecycle Changes**:
- Pattern-055, 056, 057: Design phase â†’ Emerging
- Pattern-059: Unwritten â†’ Emerging
- Patterns 046, 049: Operationalized with skills

### Agent E: Meta-Pattern Synthesizer
**Deliverable**: `dev/active/pattern-meta-synthesis.md`
**Status**: âœ… Complete

**Pattern Families Identified** (8):
1. Completion Theater (045-047, 049) - Proven, highly active
2. Grammar Application (050-058) - Emerging, strong
3. Multi-Agent Coordination (029, 059, etc.) - Mixed
4. Investigation & Root Cause (006, 042, 043, 041) - Proven
5. Architecture & Data (001-008, etc.) - Proven, health unknown
6. Integration & Platform (018, 027, etc.) - Mixed
7. AI & Intelligence (012, 019, etc.) - Mixed
8. Analysis & Discovery (036-039) - Emerging

**Emerging Meta-Patterns** (3 newly identified):
1. Parallel Specialist Tracks with Sync Alignment
2. Forcing Functions for Architecture
3. Cascade Pattern Recognition

## Phase 3: Anti-Pattern Index Update

**Deliverable**: Updated `docs/internal/architecture/current/anti-pattern-index.md`
**Status**: âœ… Complete

**Changes**:
- Added P-11 (Comment-Only Close) - discovered Jan 25
- Updated coverage from 15.5% to 28.3%
- Updated scan date to 2026-02-03
- Scanned 8 additional patterns (050-059 minus template)

## Phase 4: Validation

### FALSE POSITIVE TEST Results

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Known patterns flagged as new | NONE âŒ (passed) |
| TRUE EMERGENCE has evidence | 2 candidates with evidence âœ… |
| Pattern families validated | 8 families confirmed âœ… |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **PM Decision Required**: Should Pattern-060 (Cascade Investigation) and Pattern-061 (Design Archaeology) be formalized?

2. **Health Check Needed**: Architecture family (001-008) absent from recent logs - verify still in use vs abandoned

3. **Pattern-029 vs 059 Clarification**: Multi-agent (029) appears isolated; Leadership Caucus (059) actively used. Consider deprecation or scope clarification.

### Process Improvements

1. **Operationalize Pattern Families**: Teach patterns in family units, not individually
   - Completion Theater: 045/046/047/049 together
   - Grammar Application: 050-058 together
   - Investigation: 006/042/043/041 together

2. **Track Proto-Patterns**: Maintain informal tracking between sweeps

3. **Architecture Health Checks**: Monthly audit of dormant patterns
