# Agent Skills Index

This directory contains formalized Agent Skills - self-contained procedural instructions that transform Claude from general-purpose to specialized for specific recurring tasks.

## Available Skills

| Skill | Scope | Description | Version |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| [create-session-log](./create-session-log/SKILL.md) | Cross-role | Create properly named session logs; one log per role per day | 1.0 |
| [check-mailbox](./check-mailbox/SKILL.md) | Cross-role | Check inbox at session start, process messages, move to read/ | 1.0 |
| [close-issue-properly](./close-issue-properly/SKILL.md) | Cross-role | Close GitHub issues with evidence, updated descriptions, audit-ready records | 1.0 |
| [audit-cascade](./audit-cascade/SKILL.md) | Cross-role | Systematic audit-and-correct between phases; implements Pattern-049 | 1.0 |

## Skill Tiers

### Tier 1: Cross-Role Foundation (Mandatory)
Skills every agent should know. High frequency, low complexity.

- **create-session-log** - Start of every session
- **check-mailbox** - Session start protocol
- **close-issue-properly** - End of every tracked task
- **audit-cascade** - Between every phase of multi-step work (Pattern-049)
- **discovered-work-capture** - When noticing issues during development

### Tier 2: Role-Specific Operations
Skills for specific workflows or roles.

- **create-omnibus-log** - *(planned)* Docs agent daily synthesis
- **create-gameplan** - *(planned)* Lead Dev sprint planning
- **run-debug-protocol** - *(planned)* Systematic debugging framework

### Tier 3: Specialized Processes
Less frequent but high-value skills.

- **pattern-sweep-execution** - *(planned)* 6-week pattern analysis
- **anti-pattern-scan** - *(planned)* Emergent anti-pattern detection
- **create-adr** - *(planned)* Architecture decision records

## How to Use Skills

**Invoking a skill**: Reference by name when starting relevant work.
```
"Use the create-session-log skill to start this session."
```

**When to use**: Skills are triggered by specific contexts documented in each SKILL.md's "When to Use" section.

**Skill anatomy**: Each skill contains:
- Trigger patterns (when to use)
- Step-by-step procedure
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Quality checklist
- Examples

## Skill Formalization Trigger

**When**: During each pattern sweep (6-week cadence)
**Where**: Phase 5 of pattern sweep template

### Formalization Rubric

Score candidates against these 5 criteria. **Formalize when score â‰¥ 3**:

| Criterion | Weight | Signal |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Frequency** | 1 | Happens 3+ times per week across agents |
| **Friction** | 1 | Agents doing it inconsistently or asking "how?" |
| **Error Cost** | 1 | Mistakes cause rework or PM intervention |
| **Docs Exist** | 1 | Procedure already written somewhere (not yet a skill) |
| **Cross-Role** | 1 | Multiple roles need it (higher multiplier effect) |

### Evaluation Process

During each pattern sweep:
1. Review `dev/active/skill-harvest-candidates.md` for pending candidates
2. Score top 3-5 candidates against rubric
3. Formalize any scoring â‰¥ 3
4. Add new candidates discovered during sweep
5. Update adoption status in this index

### Example Scoring

| Candidate | Freq | Friction | Error | Docs | Cross | Score | Action |
|-----------|------|----------|-------|------|-------|-------|--------|
| create-omnibus-log | âœ“ | âœ“ | | âœ“ | | 3 | Formalize |
| run-debug-protocol | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ | 5 | Formalize |
| create-adr | | | | âœ“ | | 1 | Wait |

## Creating New Skills

New skills follow the harvest â†’ spec â†’ draft â†’ audit â†’ pilot workflow:

1. **Identify candidate** from methodology docs, CLAUDE.md, or observed patterns
2. **Write specification** in `dev/active/skill-{name}-spec.md`
3. **Draft SKILL.md** in `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`
4. **Audit** against spec and best practices
5. **Pilot test** with realistic scenarios
6. **Add to this index** with scope and version

**Metadata requirements** (per CIO guidance):
```yaml
---
scope: cross-role | role-specific
version: 1.0
created: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```
