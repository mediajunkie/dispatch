# Memo: Response to CXO PDR Feedback

**To**: Chief Experience Officer  
**From**: Principal Product Manager  
**Date**: January 4, 2026  
**Re**: Resolution of your three discussion points

---

## Summary

Your feedback was excellentâ€”exactly the sharpening questions that make PDRs stronger. All three discussion points have been resolved and incorporated. Updated PDRs attached.

---

## Discussion Point 1: Bad Last Session Edge Case

**Your observation**: Greeting table was topically smart but emotionally naive. Referencing yesterday's failed 20-minute struggle is tone-deaf.

**Resolution**: Agreed and incorporated.

Added to PDR-001 v3 greeting table:

| Condition | Greeting Approach |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Previous session ended with explicit abandonment | Fresh start: "Good morning! What can I help with?" |
| Previous session had multiple dead-ends | Soft fresh start: "Hi! Ready to pick up something new, or continue where we left off?" |

Added principle: *"Context-aware greeting is emotionally context-aware, not just topically context-aware. Sometimes the kindest acknowledgment is a clean slate."*

Added detectable abandonment signals for implementation: explicit language ("never mind," "forget it"), session closed mid-task, high dead-end ratio.

**PDR-001 â†’ v3**

## Discussion Point 2: Trust Computation Specifics

**Your question**: Should trust be visible to users?

**Resolution**: Invisible computation, visible effects, discussable on request.

Added to PDR-002 v2:

**Interaction Outcomes**:
| Outcome | Trust Effect | Signal |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Successful | +1 | User acted on response |
| Neutral | 0 | Acknowledged but didn't act |
| Negative | -1 (with floor) | Rejected, frustrated, abandoned |

**Regression rules** (with your refinement):
- 3 consecutive negatives â†’ drop one stage
- 90-day inactivity â†’ drop one stage (gentler than 30-day; never below Stage 2 once earned)
- Explicit proactivity complaint â†’ immediate drop to Stage 2

**Visibility decision**: No "Trust Level: Established" display. But if user asks "Why did you do that without asking?", Piper can explain: "Based on our history, I thought this was something you'd want. Should I check first next time?"

Trust is *discussable* without being *displayed*. Colleagues don't announce trust scores.

Flagged for Chief Architect ADR (trust computation architecture).

**PDR-002 â†’ v2**

## Discussion Point 3: Participant-First Philosophy

**Your question**: Is participant-first the right strategic stance?

**Resolution**: Yes, with "invitation to host" qualification.

Added to PDR-101 v2:

> **Piper should be an excellent participant before becoming a capable host.**

Added invitation pattern: Rather than building Host Mode and expecting users to come to it, Piper-as-participant recognizes when conversations outgrow their platform and offers:

> "This discussion is getting complex. Want me to capture it in a structured format you can navigate?"

This keeps participant-first as default while creating natural paths to Host Mode when external platforms can't provide needed structure (decision tracking, version control, multi-view navigation).

**PDR-101 â†’ v2**

## Minor Notes

**Memory boundaries**: Your "thoughtful colleague" test is now referenced in PDR-002 open questions. Remember work context and stated preferences; don't remember casual asides or inferred personal details.

**Ted's contribution path**: Confirmed as good template for future external contributors.

## Updated PDRs Attached

- PDR-002 v2 (was v1)  
- PDR-101 v2 (was v1)

## Your Deliverables (Reminder)

From the original memo, still needed:

**This week**:
- Cross-session greeting visual treatment ("continue or start fresh?" option)

**Next 2 weeks**:
- B2 Quality Rubric (evaluable criteria for "natural conversation")
- Contextual Hint UX (visual design, placement, timing, dismissal)
- Empty State Voice Guide (tone for oriented empty states)

**As capacity allows**:
- Multi-entry point FTUX exploration (sketch/wireframe)

No rush on theseâ€”flagging so they don't get lost.

*Thank you for the sharp feedback. The PDRs are stronger for it.*
