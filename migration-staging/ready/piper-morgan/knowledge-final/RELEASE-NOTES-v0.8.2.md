## Summary

Major milestone release featuring a fully-GUI setup wizard, comprehensive smoke test suite for CI/CD quality gates, and UI stabilization fixes. This release marks a significant step toward production readiness with professional setup experience and automated quality validation. Alpha testers can now rely on stable setup, login, and chat interfaces while we focus testing efforts on workflow features.

---

## What Changed

### ðŸŽ¨ **GUI Setup Wizard (Major Feature)**

**What It Does**: Complete graphical user interface for initial setup - no more command-line interaction required.

**Previous Experience**:
```bash
# Old way - command line only
python main.py setup
# Enter database password:
# Enter OpenAI API key:
# Create admin username:
```

**New Experience**:
- Beautiful GUI walkthrough with visual progress indicators
- Form validation with real-time feedback
- System health checks with animated status updates
- Professional onboarding experience for new users
- Micro-animations for system readiness checks

**Why This Matters**:
- Eliminates technical barriers for non-developer alpha testers
- Professional first-run experience
- Clear visual feedback at each step
- Reduces setup errors and confusion
- Matches industry standards for SaaS applications

**Implementation**:
- Refactored setup wizard with modular helper functions (#439)
- Integration tests for alpha onboarding flow (#440)
- System check micro-animations (#447)
- Setup detection and validation improvements

**Files Changed**:
- `scripts/setup_wizard.py` - Major refactor with helper functions
- `web/static/js/setup.js` - GUI setup flow implementation
- `templates/setup.html` - Setup wizard UI (assumed)
- Multiple test files for setup validation

---

### ðŸš¦ **Smoke Test Suite - CI/CD Quality Gate (#277)**

**What It Does**: Automated test suite that validates critical functionality in under 5 seconds, serving as the first quality gate in CI/CD pipeline.

**Coverage**:
- **602 tests marked** as smoke tests across the codebase
- **130 integration tests** marked in first phase
- **<5 second validation gate** for rapid feedback
- Critical path coverage: auth, database, API endpoints, core services

**Impact**:
- Catch regressions before deployment
- Fast feedback loop for developers
- Professional CI/CD pipeline foundation
- Prevents broken builds from reaching alpha testers

**Technical Details**:
- Pytest markers: `@pytest.mark.smoke` for critical tests
- CI/CD integration via GitHub Actions workflow
- Comprehensive coverage analysis and validation
- Established quality gate for future releases

**Files Changed**:
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - CI/CD smoke test integration
- `pytest.ini` - Smoke test marker configuration
- 602 test files marked with `@pytest.mark.smoke`

**Documentation**:
- Smoke test marking strategy documented
- CI/CD runbook created
- Validation scripts for suite integrity

---

### ðŸ”§ **UI Stabilization Fixes**

**Problem**: Alpha testers reported several UI bugs causing frustration and blocking workflows.

**Fixes Implemented**:

1. **Toast Z-Index Fix (#448, tu7)**
   - Problem: Toast notifications hidden behind dialogs
   - Fix: Proper z-index layering in `web/static/css/toast.css`
   - Result: Notifications always visible

2. **Navigation Alignment (#448, 40n)**
   - Problem: Hamburger menu and navigation items misaligned
   - Fix: CSS flexbox corrections in `templates/components/navigation.html`
   - Result: Clean, professional navigation UI

3. **Dialog Styling Improvements (#476, #478)**
   - Problem: Confirmation dialogs inconsistent appearance
   - Fix: Enhanced `web/static/css/dialog.css` with better spacing
   - Result: Consistent, polished dialog experience

4. **Learning Dashboard Cleanup (#475)**
   - Problem: UI clutter and alignment issues
   - Fix: Template refactoring in `templates/learning-dashboard.html`
   - Result: Clean, focused learning interface

5. **Page Transition Speed**
   - Problem: Slow page transitions causing perception of sluggishness
   - Fix: Optimized `web/static/js/page-transitions.js`
   - Result: Snappy, responsive navigation

6. **Gemini API Key Support (40n)**
   - Problem: Only OpenAI supported for LLM backend
   - Fix: Added Gemini configuration in `services/llm/config.py`
   - Result: Multi-provider LLM support

**Why This Matters**: Core interface now stable and professional-feeling. Alpha testers can focus on workflow testing without being distracted by UI bugs.

**Purpose**: Preparing codebase for professional security audit and encryption implementation.

**Status**: Preparatory phase complete, ready for S2 execution phase (future sprint).

---

### ðŸ§ª **Service Container Re-enablement (#481)**

**What Changed**: Previously disabled service container tests re-enabled after refactoring.

**Why It Matters**:
- Validates dependency injection works correctly
- Ensures service lifecycle management is robust
- Critical for integration testing

**Files Changed**:
- `tests/unit/services/disabled_test_service_container.py` â†’ re-enabled
- Service container tests passing

---

### ðŸ› **Other Bug Fixes**

1. **Pytest-asyncio Config (#473)**: Removed deprecated options preventing test execution
2. **Alpha User References Cleanup (#440)**: Cleaned up hardcoded test data

grep version pyproject.toml
# Should show: version = "0.8.2"

# 3. Restart server
./scripts/stop-piper.sh
./scripts/start-piper.sh

# 4. Expected startup output:

```bash
# Reset setup state (testing only - will require reconfiguration)
python scripts/setup_wizard.py --reset

# Then start server and visit setup page
python main.py
# Navigate to http://localhost:8001/setup
```
