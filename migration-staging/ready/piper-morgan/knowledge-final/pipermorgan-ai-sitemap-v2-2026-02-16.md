## Homepage Section Specification

This is the primary change in v2. Each section has a defined job, visitor mindset, and content guidance.

### Section 1: Hero

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Job** | Make the promise |
| **Visitor mindset** | "Tell me what this is" |
| **Length** | 2 lines max + CTA button |

**Content direction**:
- Headline: "THINK BIGGER"
- Subhead: "Piper holds the threads so you can focus on the decision."
- CTA: [Try Piper Morgan]

**Design notes**: Clean, confident, breathing room. No competing messages.

---

### Section 2: Trust Signal (NEW in v2)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Job** | Address AI data anxiety immediately |
| **Visitor mindset** | "Can I trust this with my stuff?" |
| **Length** | 3-4 lines |

**Content direction**:
- Lead: "Your work. Your patterns. Yours."
- Body: What Piper learns about you isn't stored in public databanks or used to train someone else's model. It stays with you.

**Design notes**: 
- Visually distinct from hero but connected (not a jarring break)
- Confident tone, not defensive
- Short — this reassures, it doesn't argue

**Why this placement**: The trust question arises *after* interest but *before* understanding. Placing it here prevents the anxiety from blocking engagement with the rest of the page.

**Connection to colleague framing**: A colleague doesn't report your conversations to a central authority. The data ownership philosophy is *why* Piper can be a colleague rather than a tool. This connection can be made explicit on /about or /methodology, but doesn't need to be stated in this section.

---

### Section 3: Differentiation

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Job** | Explain what makes Piper different |
| **Visitor mindset** | "How is this different from other tools?" |
| **Length** | Short paragraph (4-6 lines) |

**Content direction**:
- Core insight: "PM tools assume work is items in lists. But PM work is actually relationships between concerns at different scales."
- Texture: "Decisions ripple. Timelines interlock."
- Landing: "Piper is built for that reality."

**Design notes**: This is the intellectual hook for methodology-curious visitors. Keep it sharp.

---

### Section 4: What Piper Does

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Job** | Show specific capabilities |
| **Visitor mindset** | "What will it actually do for me?" |
| **Length** | 3-5 capability highlights |

**Content direction**: TBD by Comms. Possible angles:
- Morning standups that know your context
- Tracks what connects across tools
- Surfaces what matters when you need it
- Grows with you over time

**Design notes**: Can be visual (icons, cards) or prose. Should feel concrete after the abstract differentiation section.

---

### Section 5: Why Trust Us

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Job** | Provide credibility proof |
| **Visitor mindset** | "Why should I believe you?" |
| **Length** | Short section with links out |

**Content direction**:
- 160+ blog posts documenting the journey
- Open methodology, systematic approach
- Building in public since [date]
- Links to /journey, /methodology

**Design notes**: This is different from the Trust Signal (Section 2). Section 2 is about *data philosophy* ("your stuff stays yours"). Section 5 is about *credibility* ("we're doing this honestly"). Both belong; they address different concerns.

---

### Section 6: Footer CTAs

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Job** | Catch visitors ready to act |
| **Visitor mindset** | "I'm interested, what's next?" |

**Content direction**:
- Newsletter signup
- Get Involved link
- Social links
- pmorgan.tech link

---

## Trust Signal Reinforcement on Other Pages

The homepage establishes the data ownership claim. Other pages can reinforce without repeating:

| Page | Treatment |
|------|-----------|
| /try/alpha | "Your data stays local to your installation" |
| /try/beta | Standard privacy note ("We won't share your information") |
| /about | Expand into philosophy/values section |
| /methodology | Connect to "colleague" framing — why data ownership enables the relationship |

---

## Navigation Design

*Unchanged from v1*

### Primary Nav (Header)

| Item | Type | Destination |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Try Piper** | Button (emphasized) | /try |
| Get Involved | Link | /get-involved |
| Journey ▾ | Dropdown | /journey, /methodology, /playbook |
| About | Link | /about |

---

## Open Questions (Updated)

### Resolved Since v1

- **Trust Signal placement**: Confirmed — immediately after hero, before differentiation

### Still Open

1. **Journey dropdown naming**: Journey/Methodology/Playbook vs Blog/How It Works/Playbook
2. **Newsletter placement**: Footer only vs footer + /journey vs more aggressive
3. **/playbook timing**: Omit until ready (current recommendation)
4. **pmorgan.tech relationship**: Light /get-involved on pipermorgan.ai linking out (current recommendation)

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **CXO** — Sitemap v2 with trust signal section (this document)
2. → **Comms** — Draft copy for each homepage section
3. → **CXO** — Review copy for UX fit
4. → **Iterate** as needed
5. → **Designer** — Implementation gameplan

*IA sketch v2. Ready for Comms to draft homepage copy.*
