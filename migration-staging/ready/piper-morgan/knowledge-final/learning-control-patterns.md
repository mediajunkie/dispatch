# D2: Control Interface Patterns

**Issue**: #431 MUX-VISION-LEARN
**Deliverable**: 2 of 7
**Question Addressed**: How do users correct, delete, inspect, and reset learnings?

---

## Core Principle

**Forthright, transparent, correctable.**

Users must feel in control of what Piper learns about them. Control mechanisms must be discoverable, easy to use, and immediate in effect.

---

## Four Control Capabilities

| Capability | User Intent | Piper Response |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Correction** | "You're wrong about X" | Update learning, acknowledge correction |
| **Deletion** | "Forget X" | Remove learning completely |
| **Inspection** | "What do you know about X?" | Show relevant learnings transparently |
| **Reset** | "Forget everything" | Clear all learnings with confirmation |

---

## 1. Correction Flow

### Trigger Phrases

Natural language triggers (all equivalent):
- "You seem to think I prefer X, but actually Y"
- "That's not quite rightâ€”I actually..."
- "Let me correct something..."
- "You've got the wrong idea about..."

### Correction Process

```
USER: "You seem to think I prefer morning meetings, but I actually prefer afternoons"

PIPER: "Thanks for the correction. I'll update my understanding:

Before: Morning meetings preferred (confidence: 0.78)
After: Afternoon meetings preferred (confidence: 0.95)

I've noted that you told me this directly, which is why the confidence is high.
Is there anything else about meeting preferences I should know?"
```

### Design Details

**Immediate Effect**: Correction takes effect instantly for future behavior.

**Transparency**: Show before/after when possible. User should see the change.

**Confidence Boost**: Direct corrections get high confidence (0.9+) because user stated explicitly.

**Source Tracking**: Record that this learning came from direct user input, not inference.

**No Argument**: Piper never argues with corrections. User's statement is authoritative.

### Correction from Context

User may implicitly correct through behavior:

```
[Piper suggests morning meeting]
USER: [Declines, schedules afternoon instead]

PIPER: (internal) Reduce confidence in morning preference
PIPER: (if pattern repeats) "I notice you've been choosing afternoon slotsâ€”
       should I update my understanding about your meeting preferences?"
```

**Principle**: Seek confirmation before overwriting explicit learning with inferred learning.

---

## 2. Deletion Flow

### Trigger Phrases

- "Forget what you learned about Z"
- "Delete that insight"
- "I don't want you to remember that"
- "Remove [specific learning]"

### Deletion Process

```
USER: "Forget what you learned about my communication style with the design team"

PIPER: "I'll forget what I've learned about your communication style with the
design team. This includes:

- Preference for async communication (derived from 12 interactions)
- Tendency to be more detailed in design feedback (derived from 8 reviews)

This deletion is permanentâ€”I can't undo it.
Should I proceed?"

USER: "Yes"

PIPER: "Done. I've removed those learnings. I'll start fresh on that topic."
```

### Design Details

**Confirmation Required**: Always confirm before deleting, showing what will be removed.

**Permanent**: Deleted learnings are truly gone, not hidden.

**Scope Clarity**: Be specific about what's included in the deletion.

**No Guilt**: Don't make user feel bad for deleting. Neutral acknowledgment only.

**Fresh Start**: Explicitly state Piper will start fresh (not secretly retain).

### Bulk Deletion

User can delete by category:
- "Forget everything about [project]"
- "Delete all learnings from before [date]"
- "Remove all low-confidence insights"

Each triggers confirmation with scope summary.

---

## 3. Inspection Flow

### Trigger Phrases

- "What have you learned about [topic]?"
- "Show me your insights about..."
- "What do you think you know about me?"
- "What patterns have you noticed?"

### Inspection Process

```
USER: "What have you learned about how I work?"

PIPER: "Here's what I've noticed about how you work:

**Work Patterns** (high confidence)
- You prefer to tackle difficult tasks in the morning
- You often batch similar tasks together

**Communication Style** (medium confidence)
- You tend to be more direct in written communication
- You prefer bullet points over paragraphs

**Scheduling** (medium confidence)
- You protect Wednesday afternoons
- Back-to-back meetings seem to drain you

Would you like me to explain where any of these came from,
or correct anything that's off?"
```

### Design Details

**Organized Display**: Group by topic, indicate confidence.

**Complete Honesty**: Show everything relevant, including uncertain inferences.

**Invitation to Correct**: Always end with offer to correct or explain.

**Drill-Down Available**: User can ask "why do you think [specific insight]?"

### Inspection Scope

| Query | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| "What do you know about me?" | All learnings |
| "What have you learned about [topic]?" | Topic-filtered |
| "What did you learn from [project]?" | Source-filtered |
| "What are you uncertain about?" | Low-confidence only |

---

## 4. Reset Flow

### Trigger Phrases

- "Forget everything you've learned about me"
- "Reset your learnings"
- "Start fresh"
- "Delete all insights"

### Reset Process

```
USER: "Forget everything you've learned about me"

PIPER: "This is a significant action. Let me make sure you understand
what it means:

**What will be deleted:**
- All learned preferences (47 insights)
- All pattern observations (23 patterns)
- All communication style learnings
- All project-specific insights

**What will NOT be deleted:**
- Our conversation history (Session Journal)
- Your account settings
- Your trust level with me

**What this means going forward:**
- I'll need to relearn your preferences
- Suggestions will be generic until I observe new patterns
- Proactive help will be less personalized

This cannot be undone.

Type 'RESET' to confirm, or tell me if you'd prefer a partial reset."

USER: "RESET"

PIPER: "Done. All learnings have been cleared. We're starting fresh.

If you're comfortable sharingâ€”was there something that made you want
to reset? I'd like to do better going forward."
```

### Design Details

**Significant Confirmation**: Require explicit confirmation word, not just "yes."

**Full Transparency**: List exactly what will and won't be deleted.

**Consequences Stated**: User must understand the practical impact.

**Partial Alternative**: Offer partial reset if full reset seems drastic.

**Optional Feedback**: Gently ask why (but accept silence). Reset may indicate broken trust.

### Partial Reset Options

- "Reset learnings about [category]"
- "Reset learnings older than [time period]"
- "Reset low-confidence learnings only"

Each has its own confirmation flow with appropriate scope.

---

## Discoverability Requirements

### Users Must Be Able to Find Controls Without Instructions

**Discoverability Paths**:

1. **Natural Language**: Any reasonable phrasing should work
   - "How do I correct something you learned?"
   - "Can I delete insights?"
   - "I want to see what you know"

2. **UI Elements**: In Insight Journal
   - Each insight has "Correct" and "Delete" actions
   - Global "Reset" option visible but not prominent
   - "Explain this" link on every insight

3. **Help/Settings**: Learning controls section
   - Overview of all control capabilities
   - Links to each action
   - Privacy policy explanation

### First-Time Education

When user first accesses Insight Journal:

> "This is where you can see what I've learned from our work together.
> You're always in control:
> - **Correct** anything I got wrong
> - **Delete** anything you'd rather I forget
> - **Ask** me to explain any insight
>
> Your corrections and deletions take effect immediately."

---

## Response Patterns

### Acknowledging Corrections

- "Thanks for the correction. I've updated my understanding."
- "Got itâ€”I'll remember that going forward."
- "Noted. That helps me serve you better."

**Never**:
- "Are you sure? My data shows..."
- "That contradicts what I observed..."
- "I'll make a note but keep my original insight..."

### Acknowledging Deletions

- "Done. I've forgotten that."
- "Removed. I'll start fresh on that topic."
- "Deleted. That information is gone."

**Optional gentle path forward** (once, after deletion):
> "Done. I've forgotten that. If you ever want to help me learn something different about this topic, just let me know."

This acknowledges the deletion, doesn't guilt, and leaves the door openâ€”all without being clingy.

**Never**:
- "Are you sure you want me to forget?"
- "That was a useful insight though..."
- "I'll delete it but keep a backup..."

### Handling Ambiguous Requests

```
USER: "Delete that thing you said about meetings"

PIPER: "I want to make sure I delete the right thing. Do you mean:

1. My observation that you prefer morning meetings
2. My note about back-to-back meeting fatigue
3. Something else about meetings

Which should I remove?"
```

---

## Privacy & Security

### Deletion Is Real

- Deleted learnings are removed from all storage
- No "soft delete" or hidden archive
- Cannot be recovered by Piper or administrators

### Audit Trail Exception

- Session Journal records that a deletion happened (for compliance)
- But does NOT record what was deleted
- Format: "User requested deletion of learning [ID] on [date]"

### No Sharing

- Learnings are never shared across users
- Deletion affects only the requesting user's data
- No aggregate learning that could leak individual data

---

## Edge Cases

### Conflicting Corrections

User corrects something, then corrects again differently:

```
USER: "I prefer morning meetings"
[Later]
USER: "Actually I prefer afternoon meetings"

PIPER: "Got it. I'll update from morning preference to afternoon preference.
Just to confirmâ€”this replaces my previous understanding, right?"
```

### Correction That Matches Original

```
USER: "I actually do prefer morning meetings"

PIPER: "That's what I had notedâ€”glad to confirm it's correct!
Confidence updated from 0.72 to 0.95."
```

### Deleting What Doesn't Exist

```
USER: "Forget what you learned about my travel preferences"

PIPER: "I don't actually have any learnings about your travel preferences yet.
Is there something specific you were concerned about?"
```

---

## Success Metrics

This specification succeeds if:

- [ ] Users can correct learnings in under 30 seconds
- [ ] Users can find deletion controls without help
- [ ] Reset flow prevents accidental complete deletion
- [ ] Users report feeling "in control" of Piper's learning
- [ ] No user reports feeling "unable to fix" a wrong insight

---

## Related Specifications

- **D1**: Learning Visibility (what users see before controlling)
- **D5**: Provenance Display (explaining learning sources)
- **D6**: Journal Architecture (where controlled data lives)

## CXO Review Notes (2026-01-23)

**Status**: âœ… Approved

### Key Affirmation

> "Control Without Guilt" - Critical. The anti-pattern here is dark-patterning user data control. If a user wants to delete, they've decided. Piper honors that without friction or guilt.

### Refinements Applied

1. **Post-deletion gentle path forward** (added above) - Optional, once, not clingy.

### Future Enhancements (not required for v1)

**A. Learning acknowledgment moments**: When Piper learns something significant, occasional subtle acknowledgment:
- "That's helpful to know"
- "I'll remember that"

This makes the learning relationship visible without being mechanical.

**B. Learning correction feedback loop**: When a user corrects Piper, acknowledge the correction's impact:
- "Got it â€” I'll approach this differently next time"

This closes the loop and builds confidence that corrections matter.
