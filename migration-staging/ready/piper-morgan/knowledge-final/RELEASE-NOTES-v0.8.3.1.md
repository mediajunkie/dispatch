# Release Notes: v0.8.3.1

**Release Date**: January 7, 2026
**Release Type**: Patch Release (Sprint B1 FTUX improvements)

---

## Overview

This patch release delivers the Sprint B1 P0 "First Time User Experience" (FTUX) improvements, focusing on making Piper's first impression warmer and more oriented.

---

## What's New

### FTUX-PIPER-INTRO (#547)
**Piper greeting panel in setup wizard**

New users now see a friendly greeting from Piper Morgan at the start of the setup wizard:

> "Hi, I'm Piper Morgan, your PM assistant! You can call me Piper."
>
> "I'm here to help you with product management workâ€”tracking tasks, managing GitHub issues, prepping for standups, and staying on top of your calendar."

- Friendly introduction sets expectations
- Dismissible panel (doesn't block setup)
- Accessible with ARIA role and keyboard support

### FTUX-EMPTY-STATES (#548)
**Voice-guided empty state copy**

Empty states across all primary views now use Piper's voice instead of generic system messages:

| View | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Todos | "No todos yet. Create your first todo." | "No todos yet. Say 'add a todo: [task]' to create one, or I can suggest some based on your open GitHub issues." |
| Projects | "No projects found." | "No projects set up yet. Projects help me understand your work context. Say 'create a project called...' to get started." |
| Files | "No files uploaded." | "No documents in your knowledge base yet. You can upload files, connect Notion, or just paste content into our chatâ€”I'll remember it for later." |
| Lists | "No lists yet." | "No lists yet. Say 'create a list called...' to get started. Lists help you group and organize related items." |

### FTUX-POST-SETUP (#549)
**Post-setup orientation modal**

After completing setup, users now see a brief orientation modal:

> "You're all set! Here are some things we can do together..."

- Shows integration-aware suggestions (GitHub, Calendar, Todos)
- Only appears once (persisted dismissal)
- Dismissible with button or Escape key

---
