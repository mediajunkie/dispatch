# INTERACT-RECOGNITION: Design Recognition Interface Patterns

## Vision Context
**Source**: Nov 26 UX Research - Nielsen's "articulation barrier" and "Settings = abdication" principle
**Core Concept**: Users struggle to articulate what they want. Piper should let them recognize correct interpretations rather than requiring precise articulation.
**Anti-Flattening Check**: A flattened version would be autocomplete or command shortcuts. The real version is Piper demonstrating understanding through options.

## Cathedral Builder's Note
You're building the bridge between human uncertainty and AI understanding. Most users can't articulate what they want but can recognize it when they see it.
- This is about empathy, not efficiency
- Every "Did you mean..." should feel like understanding, not correction
- If this becomes autocomplete, we've failed
- Success = users feel understood, not interrogated

## The Grammar
How Recognition embodies the grammar:
- **Entities**: Both user and Piper are entities trying to understand each other
- **Moments**: The moment of recognition ("Yes, that's what I meant!")
- **Places**: Different contexts require different recognition patterns

## The Articulation Barrier Problem

### What Nielsen Discovered
- Users can't express intent precisely in writing
- "Low-articulation users" aren't less intelligent, just less practiced
- Prompt engineering is UX failure, not user failure
- Recognition is cognitively easier than generation

### What We Learned from CXO Research
From Nov 26 session:
- IDEO: 56% more ideas with AI-generated questions (scaffolding helps)
- But 28% DECREASE with AI-generated example ideas (examples constrain)
- Questions open possibilities, examples close them
- Recognition must expand, not constrain

### The Yoga Class Principle (from PM)
"Instructors don't present settings panels to beginners. They have informed opinions about what novices need."
- Piper should guide, not interrogate
- Progressive revelation based on expertise
- Recognition options should teach, not test

## Specification

### Phase 0: Research Integration (6 hours)
- [ ] Deep dive into Nielsen's articulation barrier research
- [ ] Study successful "Did you mean..." implementations (Google, etc.)
- [ ] Analyze current intent classification system
- [ ] Document where users currently get stuck
- [ ] Map articulation failures to recognition opportunities

Key Questions:
- Where do users retry commands multiple times?
- What patterns indicate articulation struggle?
- How does context affect recognition needs?
- When should Piper offer options vs take action?

### Phase 1: Recognition Pattern Framework (8 hours)
- [ ] Create taxonomy of recognition patterns
- [ ] Design progressive recognition (simple â†’ complex)
- [ ] Develop context-aware recognition rules
- [ ] Create recognition vs action decision tree
- [ ] Build pattern library with examples

Recognition Pattern Types:
1. **Clarification**: "Did you mean X or Y?"
2. **Expansion**: "I can also help with..."
3. **Correction**: "I think you might mean..."
4. **Education**: "Here's what I can do with that..."
5. **Confirmation**: "I'll do X, which includes..."

### Phase 2: Canonical Query Enhancement (12 hours)
- [ ] Review 25 existing canonical queries
- [ ] Transform from commands to recognition triggers
- [ ] Create "fuzzy matching" patterns for each
- [ ] Design progressive revelation for complex queries
- [ ] Build recognition scaffolding system

The 5 Query Categories (Enhanced):
1. **Identity Queries** â†’ "Asking about my capabilities?"
2. **Temporal Queries** â†’ "Looking for something time-related?"
3. **Spatial Queries** â†’ "Trying to navigate somewhere?"
4. **Capability Queries** â†’ "Want me to do something?"
5. **Predictive Queries** â†’ "Wondering what might happen?"

### Phase 3: Recognition Interface Design (12 hours)
- [ ] Design visual patterns for recognition
- [ ] Create micro-interactions for selection
- [ ] Build progressive disclosure system
- [ ] Design context-sensitive options
- [ ] Create accessibility-first recognition

Interface Components:
```
User: "help with the thing"

Piper: "I notice you might be asking about:
        
        ðŸ”§ The configuration issue from yesterday
           'Let me check the status of that setup problem'
        
        ðŸ“ The document you were working on
           'I can open your latest draft'
        
        ðŸ› The bug the team discussed
           'Should I pull up the GitHub issue?'
        
        Something else? Just tell me more..."
```

### Phase 4: Anti-Constraint Patterns (8 hours)
- [ ] Design patterns that expand, not limit
- [ ] Create "learning through recognition" flow
- [ ] Build expertise detection system
- [ ] Implement adaptive recognition depth
- [ ] Prevent recognition fatigue

Key Principles:
- Never more than 3-4 options initially
- Options should teach about capabilities
- Each recognition should reduce future friction
- Expert users can bypass recognition
- Recognition should feel like understanding

### Phase 5: Implementation Bridge (8 hours)
- [ ] Connect to existing intent classification
- [ ] Create fallback patterns for no recognition
- [ ] Design recognition memory system
- [ ] Build recognition analytics
- [ ] Create A/B testing framework

### Phase Z: Validation & Refinement (4 hours)
- [ ] Test with "low-articulation" users
- [ ] Measure reduction in retry attempts
- [ ] Validate recognition doesn't constrain
- [ ] Document successful patterns
- [ ] Create ongoing improvement system

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- [ ] Recognition framework implemented
- [ ] 25 canonical queries enhanced
- [ ] Intent system bridged to recognition
- [ ] Progressive revelation working

### Conceptual Success
- [ ] Articulation barrier measurably reduced
- [ ] Recognition expands, doesn't constrain
- [ ] Users learn through recognition
- [ ] Expertise progression visible

### User Experience Success
- [ ] 50% reduction in command retries
- [ ] Users report feeling understood
- [ ] New users onboard faster
- [ ] Expert users not slowed down

## Anti-Flattening Tests
1. Does recognition feel like understanding or interrogation?
2. Do options expand possibilities or constrain them?
3. Does recognition teach or just translate?
4. Is context considered in recognition?
5. Can users grow beyond need for recognition?

## The Recognition Philosophy

### It's Not Autocomplete
Autocomplete guesses the next word. Recognition understands intent and offers interpretations.

### It's Not Error Correction
Not "Did you mean to spell..." but "Are you trying to..."

### It's Not Settings
Every recognition is Piper having an informed opinion, not abdicating to user configuration.

### It's Understanding
Each recognition should feel like: "I think I understand what you're trying to do..."

## Examples of Recognition Done Right

### Example 1: Vague Request
```
User: "fix the thing"
Piper: "I see a few things that might need attention:
        â€¢ That failing test from your last commit
        â€¢ The TypeScript error in main.py
        â€¢ The TODO you marked as urgent
        Which would you like to tackle?"
```

### Example 2: Progressive Recognition
```
User: "standup"
Piper (new user): "Would you like me to:
                   â€¢ Generate your morning standup
                   â€¢ Show previous standups
                   â€¢ Configure standup settings"
                   
Piper (expert): [Immediately generates standup, knowing user's pattern]
```

### Example 3: Learning Recognition
```
User: "the usual"
Piper: "Starting your usual Monday workflow:
        â€¢ Morning standup âœ“
        â€¢ Checking weekend alerts...
        â€¢ Preparing sprint planning notes...
        (Let me know if your routine has changed)"
```

## Notes from PM
"Settings = abdication. Every setting is admission the product team couldn't decide."

Recognition is how we avoid settings. Piper recognizes what users need instead of asking them to configure it.

The Yoga instructor doesn't ask beginners to choose their poses. They guide based on expertise. Piper should do the same.
