# Pattern Sweep - Compound Learning Acceleration Tool

## Overview

The Pattern Sweep is a standalone automated pattern detection and learning acceleration system. It enables systematic discovery of code patterns, usage patterns, and coordination patterns across the entire codebase to accelerate development workflow optimization.

**Note**: As of August 18, 2025, Pattern Sweep has been decoupled from TLDR and operates as an independent tool.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Simple runner (recommended)
./scripts/run_pattern_sweep.sh --verbose

# Direct execution with session log learning
./scripts/run_pattern_sweep.sh --learn-usage-patterns --verbose

# Advanced usage
PYTHONPATH=. python3 scripts/pattern_sweep.py --pattern-sweep-only --verbose
```

## Pattern Categories

### 1. Code Patterns
- **Async Patterns**: `async with session_factory()`, context managers
- **Repository Patterns**: Repository instantiation and usage
- **Test Patterns**: Pytest markers, fixture usage
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation, try-except with logging
- **Domain Patterns**: Enum usage, workflow types

### 2. Usage Patterns
- **Methodology Patterns**: Systematic verification usage
- **Success Patterns**: Implementation completion markers
- **Debugging Patterns**: Root cause identification approaches

### 3. Performance Patterns
- **Velocity Patterns**: Rapid implementation timing detection
- **Test Execution**: TLDR timing analytics

### 4. Coordination Patterns
- **Workflow Patterns**: PM ticket completion tracking
- **Agent Coordination**: Multi-agent collaboration patterns

## Results and Storage

Pattern data is stored in `scripts/pattern_sweep_data.json` with:
- **Pattern Definitions**: Description, category, confidence scoring
- **Occurrence Data**: File locations, frequency, examples
- **History Tracking**: Sweep timeline and pattern evolution
- **Learning Data**: New vs updated pattern detection

## Standalone Operation

Pattern Sweep operates independently and can be run on-demand:

```bash
# Weekly pattern review (recommended)
./scripts/run_pattern_sweep.sh --learn-usage-patterns --verbose

# Quick pattern check
./scripts/run_pattern_sweep.sh

# Help and options
./scripts/run_pattern_sweep.sh --help
```

## Performance

- **Scan Scale**: 1,000+ Python files + 200+ documentation files (after venv exclusion)
- **Scan Duration**: ~40 seconds for full codebase
- **Pattern Detection**: 9+ patterns across 4 categories
- **Storage**: ~500KB JSON with full pattern history

## Weekly Pattern Review Process

Recommended workflow for compound learning acceleration:

1. **Weekly Sweep**: Run `./scripts/run_pattern_sweep.sh --learn-usage-patterns --verbose`
2. **Review Results**: Analyze `scripts/pattern_sweep_data.json` for new patterns
3. **Methodology Update**: Incorporate high-confidence patterns into development practices
4. **Documentation**: Update process docs with discovered patterns

## Compound Learning

Pattern Sweep enables compound learning acceleration by:
1. **Automated Pattern Discovery**: Identifies emerging patterns automatically
2. **Confidence Scoring**: Ranks patterns by frequency and distribution
3. **Learning Persistence**: Tracks pattern evolution over time
4. **Methodology Enhancement**: Enables systematic improvement of development practices

## Examples

### Top Detected Patterns (as of 2025-07-26)
1. **Root cause identification pattern** (314 occurrences, 0.83 confidence)
2. **Async test marker pattern** (220 occurrences, 1.00 confidence)
3. **Systematic verification methodology** (130 occurrences, 0.74 confidence)
4. **Workflow type usage pattern** (154 occurrences, 1.00 confidence)
5. **Repository pattern instantiation** (70 occurrences, 1.00 confidence)

### Usage Pattern Examples
- Detection of "SYSTEMATIC VERIFICATION" methodology usage
- "âœ… SUCCESS" implementation completion patterns
- "ROOT CAUSE" problem resolution patterns
- "PM-XXX COMPLETE" coordination patterns

## Integration with Development Workflow

Pattern Sweep enhances the systematic verification methodology by:
- **Pattern-First Development**: Discover existing patterns before implementing
- **Quality Assurance**: Detect antipatterns and ensure consistency
- **Velocity Intelligence**: Learn from high-velocity implementation patterns
- **Self-Improving Process**: Enable methodology evolution through pattern analysis

## Future Enhancements

Planned extensions include:
- **Real-time Pattern Detection**: Integration with file watchers
- **Pattern Suggestions**: AI-powered pattern recommendation
- **Cross-Project Learning**: Pattern sharing across repositories
- **Performance Correlation**: Link patterns to development velocity metrics
