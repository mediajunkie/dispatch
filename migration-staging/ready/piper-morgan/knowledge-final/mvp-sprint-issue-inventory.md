## Notes for Reorganization

1. **Create M0 sprint in GitHub** before creating issues
2. **Check issue statuses** before moving â€” some may already be closed
3. **Issues I couldn't definitively place** â€” come back for advice on these
4. **MUX lifecycle issues** (#703, #704, #705, etc.) â€” verify exact titles and dependencies
5. **#427 and #595** â€” may overlap with M0 work; verify scope
